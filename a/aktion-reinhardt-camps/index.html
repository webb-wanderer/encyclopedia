				When writing about the <i>Aktion Reinhardt</i> Camps, orthodox historians commonly refer to the camps <a href="/b/belzec/index.html">Belzec</a>, <a href="/s/sobibor/index.html">Sobib&oacute;r</a> and <a href="/t/treblinka/index.html">Treblinka</a>, which according to their narrative were pure extermination camps, but in fact served as mere transit camps for Jews deported to the East either for construction work or for resettlement. From a telegram sent by <a href="/h/hofle-hans/index.html">Hans H&ouml;fle</a>, we learn that the <a href="/m/majdanek/index.html">Majdanek Camp</a> near Lublin was also considered a camp of <q><i>Einsatz Reinhart,</i></q> as it is called in that document. Majdanek, however, was neither a pure extermination camp, nor was this even its secondary function. It was almost exclusively a labor camp &mdash; even in the current orthodox narrative. Right after the war, Soviet propaganda claimed that it was an extermination camp, but by 2005, this claim was all but abandoned by the orthodoxy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Documents from other camps, such as <a href="/a/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz</a>, also on occasion mentioned <a href="/a/aktion-reinhardt/index.html"><i>Aktion Reinhardt</i></a> as some aspect of their operation, although in no way connected with any murderous activities. Other documents about <a href="/a/aktion-reinhardt/index.html"><i>Aktion Reinhardt</i></a> also clearly show that this operation had nothing to do with mass murder at all. See the entry on this term for more details.
