			</ul>
			<h3>
				October 14, 2024
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Corrected typos and bad grammar, improved expressions and/or added a few more cross references in a wide range of entries (Ukraine, Vaillant-Couturier, van Roden, Veil, Venezia, Morris, Venezia, Shlomo, Ventilation, Vrba, Wannsee Conference, War Refugee Board Report, Warsaw Ghetto, Warszawski, Wedding Rings, Weiss, Weliczker, Widmann, Wiernik, Witnesses against Mass Murder, Wolff, Wolken, Yad Vashem, Yugoslavia, Zentralsauna, &#377;&#322;obnicki, Zyklon B, Zyklon-B Introduction Devices).</li>
				<li>Entry on <a href="/v/venezia-shlomo/index.html">Venezia, Shlomo</a>: a reference to a dedicated paper on this witness was added: <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Mattogno2010a">Mattogno 2010a</a>, with a related addition to the <a href="/bibliography/index.html">Bibliography</a>: Mattogno, Carlo 2010a. <q>&lsquo;The Truth about the Gas Chambers&rsquo;?,</q> <i>Inconvenient History,</i> Vol. 2, No. 1, 2010, pp. 70-125; <a href="https://codoh.com">codoh.com/library/document/the-truth-about-the-gas-chambers/</a>.</li>
				<li>Entry on <a href="/w/wiernik-jankiel-yankiel/index.html">Wiernik, Jankiel</a>: A list item was added addressing the transformation of Wiernik&rsquo;s chlorine-filling flap:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						In his first text, chlorine was poured through a flap in the roof; in later versions of his story, according to which the killing was done with exhaust gas, this chlorine-filling flap, which no longer had any purpose, mutated into a ventilation opening. Such a roof opening is not part of the current orthodox narrative, but was mentioned by two other witnesses who evidently plagiarized Wiernik&rsquo;s text (see the entries on Abraham Goldfarb and Eliyahu Rosenberg.)
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				Furthermore, a mistake regarding the plagiarized Treblinka camp map of the November 1942 report was corrected: the map is included in the English edition of Wiernik&rsquo;s text, not in the Polish edition (it was probably simply forgotten there, as a reference to it in the text points nowhere.)</li>

								This remark was removed in later editions. Over the years, orthodox historians have pointed out that the story line of both Keneally&rsquo;s book and Spielberg&rsquo;s movie are massively distorted. Spielberg openly admitted that he deliberately shot his movie in black and white and created unsteady camera effects to suggest it is a documentary of its time.

								The fact that Amon G&ouml;th was arrested and prosecuted by the SS-internal court system during the war is of course not mentioned in the movie.

							<p>
								This remark, which was not entirely true, was probably a mere legal precaution that was removed in later editions after Spielberg&rsquo;s film made the book famous. Some of the central characters and places in the novel did, of course, exist, first and foremost the German entrepreneur Oskar Schindler, who had Jewish slave laborers working in his company, and the camp commander Amon G&ouml;th as well as the two camps Auschwitz and P&#322;aszow.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, over the years, even orthodox historians have pointed out that the story line of both Keneally&rsquo;s book and Spielberg&rsquo;s movie drastically deviates from historical reality. Spielberg openly admitted that he deliberately shot his movie in black and white and created unsteady camera effects to suggest it is a documentary of its time.
							</p>
							<p>
								[&hellip;]
							</p>
							<p>
								The fact that Amon G&ouml;th was arrested and prosecuted by the SS-internal court system during the war is of course not mentioned in the movie.
							</p>
							<p>
								Finally, the glorification of Schindler as the savior of <q>his</q> slave laborers misses the point. It is true that many Jews who were deployed to work in subcamps or in companies outside the concentration camps often suffered a milder fate than prisoners who were forced to linger in the large concentration camps themselves. However, the assertion that Jews interned at Auschwitz or P&#322;asz&oacute;w and their subcamps, whether they were fit for work or not, were at risk of physical extermination, is precisely the fictional aspect of Keneally&rsquo;s work. However, it is not the product of his own imagination, but that of many witnesses and the orthodox narrative based on it. Without this gruesome yet false background, Keneally&rsquo;s book and Spielberg&rsquo;s film would never have been successful.

							<p>
								Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is the active toxic component of the pesticide Zyklon B, which has been around since the 1920s (see the entry Zyklon B for details on this product). At room temperature, HCN is a colorless liquid, but it boils already at 25.7&deg;C (78.3&deg;F). It dissolves easily in water and reacts readily with iron salts.
							</p>
							<p>
								HCN has no effect on microbial lifeforms at levels prescribed for disinfestations, hence cannot be used for disinfections. However, it is lethal above certain concentrations to multi-cellular lifeforms, such as insects and mammals.</td>

								This is just one piece of evidence that suggests that mass homicidal gassings with hydrogen cyanide never occurred.
							</p>
							<p>
								A common German trivial name for hydrogen cyanide is <q>Blaus&auml;ure</q>, meaning <q>blue acid.</q> The name is misleading for two reasons. First, this substance is not blue, but completely colorless, and second, it is only an acid when dissolved in water, but even then only to a very weak degree. The substance was given the name blue in the German-speaking world because hydrogen cyanide was first obtained in Germany through the decomposition of the blue pigment Iron Blue, a compound of oxidized iron (rust) and hydrogen cyanide (see the entry on <a href="/i/iron-blue/index.html">Iron Blue</a>). The name <q>blue acid</q> led some witnesses to claim that they had seen the poison gas as a blue haze, which is evidently untrue. (See for example the entry on <a href="/b/bock-richard/index.html">Richard B&ouml;ck</a>.)</td>

								Initially, this only affected the eastern camps threatened by the Red Army. Lublin (Majdanek) and Auschwitz were among the first camps to be subjected to this order. Some ghettos whose production facilities were classified as essential to the war effort were also evacuated. In anticipation of the Red Army&rsquo;s advance, many inmates had been transferred already earlier to camps further west. The aim of these transfers was to preserve the inmates&rsquo; labor for the German manufacturing industry. Accordingly, manufacturing plants were also relocated wherever possible. This happened, for example, in August 1944 with the inmates and the factories of the Lodz Ghetto. (See this entry.)

								<b>Time and Effort</b>

							<p>
								Single-body cremation pyres take some 6-7 hours to burn down, with an additional 6-7 hours for the hot embers to fully consume the body. Ideally, bodies should not lie next to each other on a pyre, but should be spaced apart, to allow flames and heat to rise between them. Bodies are heat sinks during most of the cremation process. Forming a large layer of bodies interferes with complete combustion. The resulting low fire temperatures beneath the bodies lead to prolonged cremation times and increased fuel requirements.
							</p>
							<p>
								Under no circumstances should bodies be stacked, since the upper layers of bodies start burning only once the lower layers have been almost completely consumed. Hence, the burning time of any stacked pyre increases proportionately with the number of layers.

				We accidentally posted a second portrait of Shlomo Venezia in the <a href="/o/olere-david/index.html">entry for David Ol&egrave;re</a>. We replaced it with an actual image showing Ol&egrave;re standing in front of one of his paintings. Apologies for this mistake.
			</p>
			<h3>

			<p>
				We fixed a few typos and added a paragraph to our Introduction at the end of the section headlined <q>Why an Encyclopedia on the Holocaust Matters,</q> saying:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					The next chapter will analyze in detail two other, older encyclopedias on the Holocaust which are considered trail-blazing by many mainstream scholars. If statistical data seem boring or irrelevant, the reader is invited to simply skip to the next chapter titled <q>A Respectable Encyclopedia.</q>
				</p>

			<p>
				The website <a href="https://holocausthandbooks.com/">Holocaust Handbooks</a> was restructured, and in the process, all links to their books and video documentaries have changed. While they have automatic redirects from the old to the new links, we took the opportunity to update all links in our Encyclopedia&rsquo;s Bibliography.
			</p>
			<p>
				The same will have to be done with links going to articles of <i>The Journal of Historical Review, The Revisionist,</i> <i>Inconvenient History</i> (IH) and the CODOH Library, as well as with two links going to www.vho.org. Both the IH and the CODOH site are currently down (hence no link here), as they are receiving a general overhaul. The domain name www.vho.org may be lost for good, hence we will have to repost the one article referred to. Once all these sites or papers are back up, and the new links are known, we will update the Encyclopedia&rsquo;s links as well. In the meantime, all we can do is to apologize for any links resulting in mere error messages of web pages not found.
			</p>
			<h3>

						<td>In fact, the latter were probably blazing at their highest intensity when Gr&ouml;ning arrived in late September 1942. <b>However, these pyres did not burn gas-chamber victims, as the orthodoxy claims, but thousands of victims of the raging typhus epidemic that had gotten out of control in the summer of 1942. (See the entry on Birkenau, and the section on Auschwitz in the entry on mass graves.) These fires left quite an impression on the young man.</b></td>

				We added two brief entries on the two individuals who took the photographs that were later assembled into what came to be known as <i>The Auschwitz Album,</i> on the arrival and processing of Jews deported from Hungary to Auschwitz in the summer of 1944: <a href="/h/hofmann-ernst/index.html">Hofmann, Ernst</a> and <a href="/w/walter-bernhard/index.html">Walter, Bernhard</a>.
			</p>

				We furthermore added a redirect for the term <q>Haavara</q> pointing to the entry on <a href="/e/emigration/index.html">Emigration</a>: <a href="/e/emigration/index.html">Haavara Agreement &rarr; Emigration</a>
