			<p>
				Mogilev is a city in eastern Belorussia. It was the location of a German PoW transit camp, where many Soviet PoWs were held captive. Due to the high death rate among them, a crematorium with several wood-fired 8-muffle cremation furnaces of the Topf Company from Erfurt, Germany, was slated to be built there. However, that &hellip;

			</h3>
			<p>
				The Neuengamme Concentration Camp was established in 1938 near a village of the same name some 13 miles southeast of Hamburg. Its relevance for Holocaust historiography lies in claims about a few select homicidal gassings in that camp. There is no wartime source for this. No documents confirm any witness claim in this regard, and &hellip;

				At a military training ground near the German town of Ohrdruf, some 16 miles southwest of Thuringia&rsquo;s capital Erfurt, a forced-labor camp was established in November 1944. Due to Germany&rsquo;s rapid collapse at that time, the camp never had a chance of developing any proper infrastructure. Therefore, living conditions were atrocious, death rates catastrophic.
