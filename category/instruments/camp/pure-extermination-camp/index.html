			</h3>
			<p>
				When writing about the Aktion Reinhardt Camps, orthodox historians commonly refer to the camps Belzec, Sobibór and Treblinka, which according to their narrative were pure extermination camps, but in fact served as mere transit camps for Jews deported to the East either for construction work or for resettlement.

				Documented History The Chełmno Camp [German name: Kulmhof] was located some 40 miles northwest of the Polish city of Łódź.
