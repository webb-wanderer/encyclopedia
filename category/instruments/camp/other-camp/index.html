				The Buchenwald Camp was located some 4 miles northwest of the central-German city of Weimar. No historian has ever claimed or is currently claiming that any kind of systematic extermination of inmates by any technical means occurred at the Buchenwald Camp. Therefore, this camp would not have a place in an encyclopedia on the Holocaust, &hellip;

				When the Mauthausen Camp became overcrowded in 1939, subcamps were established a few miles west of the Mauthausen Camp to house inmates near to their worksites. Eventually, three such camps near the creek Gusen were established, named Gusen I through III. Of particular interest for Holocaust historiography is the cremation furnace established at the Gusen &hellip;

				At a military training ground near the German town of Ohrdruf, some 16 miles southwest of Thuringia&rsquo;s capital Erfurt, a forced-labor camp was established in November 1944. Due to Germany&rsquo;s rapid collapse at that time, the camp never had a chance of developing any proper infrastructure. Therefore, living conditions were atrocious, death rates catastrophic.
