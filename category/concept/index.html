			<p>
				Terms Similar to the English term bunker, the German term Bunker can refer to three things: A shelter facility protecting from projectiles, bombs, shrapnel or noxious gases in times of armed conflicts. Bulk-item storage facilities, such as potatoes, coal or coke. The German language even has a verb for this: einbunkern, to store in bulk &hellip;

				Corporate Censorship As long as plenty of companies compete with each other offering similar services, chances are high that someone will offer these services &mdash; even to individuals or groups whose views are rejected by many if not most in a society. However, the situation changes as market shares in a certain market get more &hellip;

			</h3>
			<p>
				Facing an astounding lack of documents supporting the claim that a <q>Holocaust</q> was going on, orthodox scholars resort to the auxiliary hypothesis that the National-Socialist bureaucrats used code words when writing their documents. These code words stated one thing, when in fact something entirely different was meant. The 1993 book Nazi Mass Murder is a &hellip;

			</h3>
			<p>
				Israel After it had turned its Arab neighbors into lethal enemies with its genocidal war of 1948, Israel had to maintain huge armed forces to secure its spoils of war and prevent an Arab revenge. These armed forces were utterly disproportionate to Israel&rsquo;s financial and economic abilities. Hence, within a few years, Israel was in &hellip;

				<a href="/concept/construction-office/index.html">Construction Office</a>

			<p>
				Every concentration camp of the Third Reich had a construction office (Bauleitung), which was in charge of building and maintaining the camp and its facilities. During the initial setup of a camp, this office was usually called a <q>new-construction office</q> (Neubauleiung). Larger camps (that had subcamps with their own construction offices) had one that organized &hellip;

			<p>
				The <q>convergence of evidence</q> is a paradigm based on the observation that seemingly independent pieces of evidence all, or at least in their majority, point in the same general direction of an event or a perpetrator, even if they disagree on particulars. Historically, this paradigm was first applied by the judiciary during medieval witch trials&hellip;.

				In preparation for the Polish show trial against former Auschwitz camp commandant Rudolf Höss, Polish engineer Dr. Roman Dawidowski and Polish Investigating Judge Jan Sehn rummaged through the documents left behind by the SS at Auschwitz. They were searching for evidence for the existence and operation of homicidal gas chambers. They found several documents with &hellip;

				<a href="/concept/demography-jewish/index.html">Demography, Jewish</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Six million Jews died in the Holocaust. This is a common assertion by the orthodoxy. However, the claim that six million Jews were threatened to perish, were in the process of perishing or had perished, is much older than World War Two. It appeared for the first time in the late 1880s &mdash; with respect &hellip;

				<a href="/concept/evidence/index.html">Evidence</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Technically speaking, evidence is an object or piece of information aiming to prove the veracity, or at least high probability, of a particular claim. Not all pieces of evidence are created equal. In science as well as in jurisprudence, there exists a general hierarchy of the types of evidence, ranked by their ability to prove &hellip;

			<p>
				In the context of the Jewish Holocaust, the term <q>extermination camp</q> refers to camps established by the German authorities or any of their allies with the claimed exclusive, main or auxiliary purpose of exterminating inmates in masses, either by mass execution (shooting) or by mass gassings in stationary gas chambers or mobile gas vans.

			<p>
				One of the most contentious issues about the Holocaust is the alleged <q>language of genocide,</q> that is, the claim that Hitler, Goebbels, Himmler and others used explicit language in their speeches and writings that called for the mass murder of Jews. Indeed, this is often cited as <q>proof</q> of genocidal intention, and as <q>proof</q> that &hellip;

				<a href="/concept/false-memory-syndrome/index.html">False-Memory Syndrome</a>

			<p>
				Scientific research shows that even mildly manipulative interviewing techniques, repeated multiple times, succeed in implanting false memories into roughly one third of all average adults, making them firmly believe that they experienced events that never happened (Loftus 1994, 1997, 2003). It has also been demonstrated that the human memory is more easily manipulated when questioning &hellip;

			<p>
				The term <q>final solution</q> (German: Endlösung &mdash; end/terminal/final solution) within the context of what National Socialists called the <q>Jewish Question</q> first appeared in a letter written on 24 June 1940 by Reinhardt Heydrich, head of Germany&rsquo;s Department of Homeland Security (Reichssicherheitshauptamt), to Joachim von Ribbentrop, German Minister of Foreign Affairs. In this letter, Heydrich asserted &hellip;

				After Germany&rsquo;s victory over Poland and the annexation of West Prussia and the Warthe Region in early 1940, German officials developed a plan called <q>Generalplan Ost</q> (<q>General Plan East</q>) that aimed at Germanizing these regions and resettling those parts of the population that they thought could not be integrated, including all Jews. These people were &hellip;

			<p>
				The term <q>genocide</q> was legally defined only in 1948, when the United Nations adopted its genocide convention (see https://www.un.org/en/genocide-prevention/1948-convention). According to this convention, genocide does not require the mass murder of members of a defined group because they belong to that group. Already any measure that causes serious bodily or mental harm, deliberately creates conditions &hellip;

				Many alleged Holocaust crime sites are said to have included pits of various depths. These would have been dug for one of two reasons: either to bury (temporarily or permanently) victims&rsquo; bodies, or to use as <q>burn pits</q> to dispose of the corpses. In the second case, the burnings allegedly occurred either immediately after their &hellip;

				Healthcare provided by the SS in German concentration camps is said to have been of very low quality, if it existed at all. Inmates too sick or injured to be cured quickly are said to have been killed in order to get rid of <q>useless eaters.</q> But like so many aspects of the orthodox Holocaust &hellip;

The worst of recorded history is probably the auto-genocide perpetrated in Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1979. Up to a third of the entire Cambodian population is said to have been slaughtered during that time. In absolute death-toll figures, the genocide &hellip;

				While many high-ranking German wartime officials claimed ignorance after the war about a National-Socialist extermination program of the Jews, Hermann Göring was the first person to express skepticism about the Holocaust narrative imposed upon the world by the prosecution during the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal (see the entry on him, and Heliotis 2018b).

				For many centuries, it was dangerous to state in public that God does not exist, that Jesus is not God&rsquo;s son, that he was not born of a virgin, and that he did not rise to the heavens. Today, saying these things is trivial. However, a similar reaction to what was earned for these statements &hellip;
