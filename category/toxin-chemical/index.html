			</h3>
			<p>
				Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless and odorless gas which is highly toxic to vertebrate animals, but not to non-vertebrates such as insects. CO clings more strongly than oxygen to the hemoglobin of vertebra blood, hence preventing oxygen transportation by the blood. Since the combination of CO and hemoglobin is more intensely red than the &hellip;

			<p>
				DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane), first synthesized in 1874 by Austrian chemist Othmar Zeidler, was discovered to be a formidable insecticide only in 1939 by Swiss Chemist Paul M체ller, who won the 1948 Nobel Prize in Medicine for it. Due to its carcinogenic features and its devastating effects on birds&rsquo; ability to reproduce, it was later banned. In &hellip;

			<p>
				Diesel-engine exhaust gases are claimed by numerous witnesses &mdash; including during the trial against John Demjanjuk in 1987 &mdash; to have been used to mass-murder Jews in the camps at Belzec, Sobib처r and Treblinka, and in some of the so-called gas vans. However, diesel-engine exhaust gas is notoriously low in its most toxic component, carbon &hellip;

				Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is the active toxic ingredient in the pesticide Zyklon B, which has been around since the 1920s (see the entry Zyklon B for details on this product). At room temperature, HCN is a colorless liquid, but it boils already at 25.7째C (78.3째F). It dissolves easily in water and reacts readily with iron &hellip;

				Iron Blue is the standard name for a broad variety of pigments formed of iron and cyanide that can exhibit a variety of hues, ranging from dark blue to greenish turquoise. It is formed of a mixture of bi- and trivalent iron cations in the presence of cyanide anions. Other names frequently used are Prussian &hellip;

				In the past, the chemical phenol has been a medical and instrument disinfectant used in hospitals all over the world. It was also used by the inmate infirmary of the Auschwitz Camp for this purpose. The camp&rsquo;s documentation contains several orders of phenol by employees of the infirmary (see Mattogno 2023, Part 1, pp. 140, &hellip;

				The early era of industrialization was an era of coal and coke. Steam machines were driven by coke and coal fires, homes were heated with them, food was cooked with them, and an entire industry evolved around producing coke from coal and using the by-product &mdash; <q>coal gas</q> or <q>city gas</q> &mdash; to provide heating, &hellip;

				History One of the most efficient methods to fight lice and thereby to contain and eliminate typhus &mdash; and to kill other vermin like grain beetles, fleas, cockroaches, termites, mice, rats and many more as well &mdash; is their poisoning with highly volatile hydrogen cyanide. Liquid hydrogen cyanide has a short shelf life and is &hellip;
