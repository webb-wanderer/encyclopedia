			</h3>
			<p>
				Among the vast documentation of the Auschwitz Camp are documents showing that the camp&rsquo;s dentistry collected and submitted to the camp&rsquo;s Political Department, on regular intervals, gold and other precious metal alloys originating from tooth fillings. The orthodoxy presents these as proof of the claim that members of the Sonderkommando had to extract gold teeth &hellip;

				During the Second World War, all inmates admitted to any kind of camp of the Third Reich had to have their hair shorn and kept trim during the entire time of their incarceration. Exceptions were granted only in special cases. This is graphically demonstrated by the so-called Auschwitz Album showing shorn male and female inmates &hellip;

				There are plenty of photographs and film footage of tattooed human skin, allegedly taken from deceased or murdered inmates of German wartime camps. Especially famous is film footage recorded by U.S. troops after liberating the Buchenwald Camp. They had set up a table there, onto which they had arranged all kinds of objects which were &hellip;

				Morgues, also called mortuaries, serve to temporarily store human corpses awaiting identification, autopsies and burial or cremation. To slow decay, they are usually chilled to temperatures close to the freezing point, and they are equipped with efficient ventilation systems to remove gases resulting from decomposition. In the context of the Holocaust, it is worthwhile knowing &hellip;

				Both the Auschwitz Museum and the Majdanek Museum have an exhibit on display showing what are said to be the shoes of former camp inmates. (See the illustrations.) The shoes of Majdanek used to be piled up in a barracks, where the Soviets photographed them in the summer of 1944. They presented these photographs as &hellip;

			<p>
				At the Buchenwald Camp shortly after its occupation by U.S. American troops in April 1945, the U.S. Armed Forces&rsquo; Psychological Warfare Division (PWD) set up a table displaying items meant to prove National-Socialist atrocities. For <q>educational</q> purposes, the local population was forced to walk by this table and hear a U.S. official in uniform explain &hellip;

				Attentive observers have noted items or facilities at the so-called death camps that seem entirely inappropriate, and which in fact suggest a much-more benign usage of those camps. The brothel at the Auschwitz Main Camp is one such item, and the <q>zoo</q> at Treblinka is another. Then we have the barber shop, dentist, and shoemaker &hellip;

The rings were found near the Buchenwald concentration camp following liberation by US Army soldiers. Germany, May 1945.</q> Note that these objects all look &hellip;
