				Although Bulgaria was Allied with wartime Germany, no Jews were deported from that country or murdered there. Since Bulgaria was known as a relatively safe haven, several thousand Jews actually sought and found refuge there. (See the entry on Jewish demography for a broader perspective.)

Plans to deport them were leaked around that time, resulting in a large-scale rescue operation by Danish civilians, helping almost all Jews to escape to Sweden, where they were welcome. Some 500 Jews were arrested and deported to the &hellip;

These Jews are said to have been deported to the Treblinka Camp. In the spring and summer of 1943, some 40,000 Jews from Greece were deported by German forces to Auschwitz&hellip;.

With these temporary territories also came many additional Jews. While Hungary proper had some 400,000 Jews, that number swelled to 725,000 with the new territories, plus thousands of &hellip;
