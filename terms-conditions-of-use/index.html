			</h4>

The inclusion of the Customer&rsquo;s own conditions is hereby denied, unless otherwise agreed.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>1.2</b> These T&amp;C apply accordingly to contracts for the delivery of vouchers, unless expressly stipulated otherwise.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>1.3</b> A consumer within the meaning of these T&amp;C is any natural person who concludes a legal transaction for purposes that can attributed predominantly neither be to their commercial nor their independent professional activity. An entrepreneur within the meaning of these T&amp;C is a natural or legal person or a legal partnership which, when concluding a legal transaction, is exercising their commercial or independent professional activity.
			</p>
			<h4>
				<a name="2"></a>2) Conclusion of Contract
			</h4>
			<p>
				<b>2.1</b> The product descriptions contained in the Seller&rsquo;s online shop do not represent binding offers on the part of the Seller, but serve for the submission of a binding offer by the Customer.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>2.2</b> The Customer can submit the offer using the online order form integrated in the Seller&rsquo;s internet shop. After placing the selected goods in the virtual shopping cart and going through the electronic ordering process, the Customer submits a legally binding contract offer with regard to the goods in the shopping cart by clicking the button that concludes the ordering process, and by clicking the pertinent check box, he agrees to these T&amp;C. Furthermore, the Customer can also submit the offer to the Seller by phone, fax, email or regular mail.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>2.3</b> The Seller can accept the Customer&rsquo;s offer placed through Seller&rsquo;s website at <a href="https://holocaustencyclopedia.com/product/holocaust-encyclopedia/">holocaustencyclopedia.com/shop/</a> within five days,
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>by sending the Customer a written order confirmation or an order confirmation in text form (fax or e-mail), whereby the receipt of the order confirmation by the Customer is decisive, or</li>
				<li>by delivering the ordered goods to the Customer, whereby the receipt of the goods by the Customer is decisive, or</li>
				<li>by asking the Customer to pay after placing his order.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				If more than one of the aforementioned conditions are met, the contract is concluded at the time at which any of the aforementioned alternatives occurs first. The period for accepting the offer begins on the day after the offer is sent by the Customer and ends at the end of the fifth day following the submission of the offer. If the Seller does not accept the Customer&rsquo;s offer within the aforementioned period, this is considered to be a rejection of the offer, with the result that the Customer is no longer bound by his declaration of intent.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>2.4</b> When submitting an offer via the Seller&rsquo;s online order form, the contract text is saved by the Seller, and a copy is sent to the Customer by email.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>2.5</b> Before the binding submission of the order via the Seller&rsquo;s online order form, the Customer can identify possible input errors by carefully reading the information displayed on the screen. An effective technical means for better recognition of input errors can be the enlargement function of the browser, with the help of which the representation on the screen is enlarged. The Customer can correct his entries as part of the electronic ordering process using the usual keyboard and mouse functions until he clicks the button that concludes the ordering process.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>2.6</b> English and German are available for the conclusion of the contract. Customer can switch between the languages using the language-option drop-down menu of Seller&rsquo;s website.
