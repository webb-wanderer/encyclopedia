<p>Each of our entries has a sound file posted at the top, which you can use to listen to the entry, rather than read it. We also strive to post videos along with each entries, but this is an ambitious project that will take some time to unfold. Hence, for now, we only have a few select topics accompanied by video documentaries.</p>
