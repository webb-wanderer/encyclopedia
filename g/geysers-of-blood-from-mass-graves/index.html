				Geysers of Blood, from Mass Graves
			</h2>
			<audio controls src="/wp-content/uploads/GeysersOfBlood.mp3"></audio>
			<p>
				Some witnesses have claimed that <a href="/m/mass-graves/index.html">mass graves</a> filled with murdered Jews emitted geysers of blood. It ought to be unnecessary to provide scientific proof for this to be physically impossible. Among those who claimed this are:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="/e/eichmann-adolf/index.html">Adolf Eichmann</a></li>
				<li><a href="/m/marcus-kurt/index.html">Kurt Marcus</a></li>
				<li><a href="/w/wiesel-elie/index.html">Elie Wiesel</a></li>
				<li><a href="/r/reder-rudolf/index.html">Rudolf Reder</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Related, but not quite as extreme, are claims that the victims buried in mass graves had soaked the soil with so much blood that one waded through bloody mud (<a href="/g/garbarz-moshe/index.html">Moshe Garbarz</a>), that an entire lake of blood had formed (<a href="/m/manusevich-david/index.html">David Manusevich</a>), or that the blood rose to a grave&rsquo;s surface and ignited there, as if it were oil (<a href="/r/rajchman-chil/index.html">Chil Rajchman</a>). Albert Hartl, an official of Germany&rsquo;s Department of Homeland Security (<i><a href="/r/reichssicherheitshauptamt/index.html">Reichssicherheitshauptamt</a></i>), claimed the following about a huge mass grave he once claimed to have seen (<a href="/bibliography/index.html#Sereny">Sereny</a>, p. 97):
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					At one moment &mdash; we were driving along a long ravine. I noticed strange movements of the earth: clumps of earth rose into the air as if by their own propulsion &mdash; and there was smoke: it was like a low-toned volcano; as if there was burning lava just beneath the earth.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				When Hartl was interrogated by U.S. investigators after the war, they added a remark to his file stating that Hartl <q>is known as a boaster of the highest order.</q> (See <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Mattogno2021c">Mattogno 2021c</a>, pp. 69f.). He was not the only one. The sad thing is that witnesses telling such tall tales are still taken seriously by orthodox scholars.
