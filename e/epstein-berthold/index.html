				Berthold Epstein was a professor of medicine from Prague, who was incarcerated at the <a href="/a/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz Camp</a> until it was captured by the Soviets on 27 January 1945. Together with three other European professors &mdash; <a href="/f/fischer-bruno/index.html">Bruno Fischer</a>, <a href="/l/limousin-henri/index.html">Henri Limousin</a> and <a href="/m/mansfeld-geza/index.html">G&eacute;za Mansfeld</a> &mdash; and coached by their Soviet conquerors, he signed an appeal on 4 March 1945 <q>To the International Public,</q> which contained many untrue propaganda clich&eacute;s about Auschwitz: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>On arrival at the railway ramp, selections of inmates for the gas chambers were conducted by the ineluctable Dr. <a href="/m/mengele-josef/index.html">Josef Mengele</a> while whistling a tune.</li>
				<li>The gas-chamber doors were opened after only four minutes ventilation time. This would have never sufficed for any of the claimed gassing facilities at Auschwitz.</li>
				<li>Gigantic <a href="/o/open-air-incinerations/index.html">open-air incineration</a> pyres operated during the time when transports with Jews deported from <a href="/h/hungary/index.html">Hungary</a> arrived in May-July 1944. However, <a href="/a/air-photos/index.html">air photos</a> prove that no such pyres existed at Auschwitz during that time.</li>
				<li>Oils and fats were extracted from corpses to assist in their cremation, thus saving other fuel. However, <a href="/f/fat-extracted-from-burning-corpses/index.html">fat</a> catches fire and burns as soon as it comes into contact with fire or embers, so no fat can be extracted from a corpse on a pyre.</li>
				<li>The corpses were processed to obtain technical oils, machinery grease and laundry soap.</li>
			</ul>
