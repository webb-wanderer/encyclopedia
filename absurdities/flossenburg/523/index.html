				The Flossenbürg Camp in the Bavarian town of the same name was located close to the border to Czechia, some 60 miles east-northeast of Nuremberg. <a href="/historical-person/legal-professional/pinter-stephen-f/index.html">Stephen Pinter</a>, the U.S. chief investigator preparing the prosecution against former staff members of the Flossenbürg Camp after the war, came to the conclusion that no <a href="/instruments/tool/homicidal-gas-chamber/index.html">homicidal gas chamber</a> ever existed at that camp. Today, all historians agree with that conclusion. That didn&rsquo;t stop former inmates from making gas-chamber claims, though, as it was fashionable for <q>witnesses</q> during the first few decades after the war to claim gas chambers for every camp. One such person was <a href="/witness/victim/friedman-arnold/index.html">Arnold Friedman</a>, who, in his 1972 book <i>Death Was Our Destiny,</i> wrote that the SS tried to gas him at Flossenbürg, but that he managed to survive by breathing through the door&rsquo;s keyhole &mdash; as if homicidal gas-chamber doors are locked with simple keys &hellip; (See the entry on <a href="/witness/victim/friedman-arnold/index.html">Arnold Friedman</a> for an excerpt.)
			</p>
			<p>
				For the longest time, even the <a href="/legal/institution/yad-vashem/index.html">Yad Vashem</a> Archives had a photograph of the Flossenbürg inmate shower room, mendaciously and maliciously mislabeled as follows:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					Flossenbürg, Germany, Gas chambers, which were called showers.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				It used to have Archival Signature 4029, Album No. FA256/40 (retrieved online in 2019), but it seems to have been removed since. Had this photo been taken from a different angle, showing the many windows in this real, once-working shower room (see the illustrations), no skeptical mind would have ever believed it.
