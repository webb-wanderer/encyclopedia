				Trawniki was a forced-labor camp located half way between the <a href="/instruments/camp/pure-extermination-camp/belzec/index.html">Belzec</a> and <a href="/location/camps/sobibor/index.html">Sobib√≥r</a> Camp. It was established in the fall of 1941. Some 20,000 Jewish inmates are said to have passed through this camp. The camp also served as a training facility for SS men, among them Soviet PoWs, most of them Ukrainians, who volunteered to serve as guards in various German camps.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the fall of 1943, 10,000 Jewish inmates of the Trawniki Camp were relocated to other camps during a major operation of relocating SS-owned and operated companies together with their Jewish labor force. The orthodoxy has dubbed this <a href="/event/operation-harvest-festival/index.html">Operation <q>Harvest Festival,</q></a> claiming that all these Jews (plus many more from the <a href="/instruments/camp/majdanek/index.html">Majdanek</a> Camp), were killed. (See the related entries for more information.)
			</p>
			<p>
				No historian claims that any mass murder using execution facilities took place in the Trawniki Camp. There is neither material, documental nor anecdotal evidence to support such a claim. However, that did not stop Polish and Jewish groups from claiming otherwise anyway.
			</p>
			<p>
				Between April and June 1942, Polish underground sources spread the <q>information</q> that Jews were being killed in masses at Trawniki using toxic gases in <a href="/instruments/tool/homicidal-gas-chamber/index.html">gas chambers</a>, after which the victims&rsquo; bodies were burned in a primitive crematorium. This was presented to the public as the <q>truth</q> by the Polish government in its London exile in July of 1942. Jewish sources, such as the <i>Jewish Telegraphic Agency,</i> repeated that disinformation in 1942 and 1943.
			</p>
			<p>
				This <a href="/instruments/camp/phantom-extermination-camps/index.html">phantom extermination camp</a> is a creation of black-propaganda sources.
