			<p>
				The term <q>final solution</q> (German: <i>Endlösung</i> &mdash; end/terminal/final solution) within the context of what National Socialists called the <q>Jewish Question</q> first appeared in a letter written on 24 June 1940 by <a href="/persons/heydrich-reinhardt/index.html">Reinhardt Heydrich</a>, head of Germany&rsquo;s Department of Homeland Security (<a href="/legal/institution/reichssicherheitshauptamt/index.html"><i>Reichssicherheitshauptamt</i></a>), to Joachim von Ribbentrop, German Minister of Foreign Affairs. In this letter, Heydrich asserted that, after conquering Poland with its three million Jews, the Jewish problem could no longer be solved <q>by <a href="/plans-orders/emigration/index.html">emigration</a>,</q> as was done so far. Now, <q>a territorial final solution</q> was required, which implied that some territory was to be put aside for the Jews as a kind of homeland or reservation. (For more, see the entry on <a href="/persons/heydrich-reinhardt/index.html">Reinhardt Heydrich</a>.)
			</p>
			<p>
				The quantitative challenge got exacerbated after Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Many more million Jews living in the Soviet Union were expected to be soon under German control. For that reason, <a href="/persons/goring-hermann/index.html">Hermann Göring</a> expanded Heydrich&rsquo;s role in a letter dated 31 July 1941. Reinhardt Heydrich&rsquo;s task now encompassed all of Germany&rsquo;s area of influence in Europe. Heydrich was to submit a draft plan to implement this final solution of the Jewish question. In this document, Göring used the terms <i>Gesamtlösung</i> (total or comprehensive solution) and <i>Endlösung</i> (end or final solution) synonymously. (See the entry on <a href="/persons/goring-hermann/index.html">Hermann Göring</a> for more details.)
			</p>
			<p>
				The orthodoxy insists that the term <q>final solution</q> ultimately meant the total physical extermination of Europe&rsquo;s Jews. The two documents mentioned here prove this to be untrue. A long string of documents created after these two documents also point to the fact that <q>final solution</q> did not refer to any physical extermination, but to a program of ruthless ethnic cleansing by deporting the Jews to some territory reserved for them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, many other documents addressing the question of what to do with the inmates in Germany&rsquo;s various camps confirm that no policy of physical extermination was in place.
