				Oskar Gröning (10 June 1921 – 9 March 2018), SS <i>Unterscharführer,</i> was deployed from late September 1942 in the department that stored and administered inmate valuables at the <a href="/a/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz</a> Camp. Although several criminal investigations were initiated after the war, all were eventually shelved.
			</p>
			<p>
				He volunteered to give an interview for the 2005 BBC atrocity-propaganda movie <i>Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State</i>. During that interview, he stated that he wanted to speak out also in order <q>to oppose the Holocaust deniers,</q> and then he exclaimed (see the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Gr%C3%B6ning">German Wikipedia entry on Gröning</a>):
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<i>Weil ich den Leugnern sagen will: Ich habe die Krematorien gesehen, ich habe die offenen Feuerstellen gesehen.</i> [&hellip;] <i>Ich war dabei.</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					Because I want to tell the deniers: I have seen the crematoria, I have seen the open fireplaces. [&hellip;] I was there.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				That wasn&rsquo;t good enough for the BBC, though, who falsified that sentence and added gas chambers into the mix by translating as follows (underscore added; see the <a href="https://pbs.org/auschwitz/about/transcripts_6.html">PBS transcript</a>):
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					Because I want to tell those deniers: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I have seen the gas chambers,</span> I have seen the crematoria, I have seen the burning pits. [&hellip;] I was there.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Gröning was a minor bureaucrat in an office at the <a href="/a/auschwitz-main-camp/index.html">Auschwitz Main Camp</a> handling inmate valuables. He would not have been allowed to walk into any of the crematoria or to the so-called <q><a href="/b/bunkers/index.html">bunkers</a></q> in order to <q>see</q> the gas chambers or watch a gassing, so the BBC once again made a fool of themselves with this forgery. Furthermore, Gröning was evidently entirely oblivious of what the <q>deniers</q> claim. He was fighting a <q>straw denier.</q> As can be seen from the entries on <a href="/instruments/tool/crematoria/index.html">crematoria</a> and <a href="/o/open-air-incinerations/index.html">open-air incinerations</a>, no one denies the existence of crematoria and <q>open fireplaces</q> at Auschwitz. In fact, the latter were probably blazing at their highest intensity when Gröning arrived in late September 1942. However, these pyres did not burn gas-chamber victims, as the orthodoxy claims, but thousands of victims of the raging typhus epidemic that had grown out of control in the summer of 1942. (See the entry on <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/birkenau/index.html">Birkenau</a>, and the section on Auschwitz in the entry on <a href="/locations/other-crime-scene/mass-graves/index.html#Auschwitz">mass graves</a>.) These fires left quite an impression on the young man. But his legitimate seeing of crematoria buildings and open-air burnings does not prove any mass-extermination claim.
			</p>
			<p>
				Considering the fallibility of human memory, and in particular the issue of <a href="/concepts/false-memory-syndrome/index.html">false memories</a> planted by 60 years of incessant one-sided propaganda, expecting an 83-year-old geriatric, utterly unfamiliar with actual revisionist research, to <q>refute</q> them is irresponsible at best, if not utterly ridiculous.
			</p>
			<p>
				Due to his media appearances resulting from his BBC interview, Gröning was eventually indicted in Germany for aiding in the murder of at least 68,000 persons. After a show trial descending into a theater of the absurd in 2015, with a 94-year old defendant suffering from dementia reading from a script prepared for him, and accused by similarly old and demented <q>witnesses</q> (see <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Winter">Winter 2015</a>), Gröning was sentenced to four years imprisonment. In 2018, at age 97, he was ordered to serve his time, but he died before setting foot in prison.
