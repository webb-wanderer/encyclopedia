				Hermine Kranz was a Slovakian Jewess deported to <a href="/a/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz</a> towards mid-1942. She testified during the British <a href="/legal/trial/bergen-belsen-trial/index.html">Bergen-Belsen Show Trial</a>, and signed a deposition on 9 May 1945, in which she declared as having personally seen when visiting the <q>gas chamber,</q> or having been told by inmates working there, that:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>There were altogether six such <a href="/instruments/tool/crematoria/index.html#Auschwitz_Main">crematoria</a> &mdash; while there were actually only five: four in <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/birkenau/index.html">Birkenau</a> and one at the <a href="/a/auschwitz-main-camp/index.html">Main Camp</a>.</li>
				<li>The victims entered the <a href="/instruments/tool/homicidal-gas-chamber/index.html">gas chamber</a> through an iron door &mdash; while all <a href="/technologies/gastight-doors/index.html">doors</a> at Auschwitz were in fact made of simple wooden planks.</li>
				<li>Three thousand persons could be dealt with at a time &mdash; with a room of 210 m&sup2;, however, that amounts to a <a href="/concepts/packing-density-inside-gas-chamber/index.html">packing density</a> of some 14.5 people per square meter, which is physically impossible.</li>
				<li><a href="/absurdities/towels-soap-toothbrushes-inside-gas-chambers/index.html">Towel and soap</a> were given to each person entering the gas chamber &mdash; that would not have happened, though. Imagine 3,000 towels and pieces of soap between three thousand corpses. Retrieving and cleaning them would have been a huge task, but ditching them would have been a huge waste.</li>
				<li>The gas chamber was also used as an anatomical research laboratory &mdash; actually, the laboratory was upstairs near the furnace room.</li>
				<li>The gas chamber had a very pretty tiled floor &mdash; when in fact nowhere in any of the crematoria were any floor tiles used.</li>
				<li>In the gas chamber, there were benches all around &mdash; but why in the world would anyone put benches into a gas chamber? The orthodoxy claims that these were located in the undressing room instead.</li>
				<li>In the gas-chamber floor there were trap doors which opened after the gassing. Under these were trucks, into which the bodies fell. They were then driven to the furnace. This is a wild fantasy conclusively proving that Kranz made it all up.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Repeating the clich√©s, she moreover stated: <q>Dr. <a href="/persons/politician/mengele-josef/index.html">Mengele</a> was always present.</q>
