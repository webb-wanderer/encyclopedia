			<p>
				Mordecai Lichtenstein wrote a report in 1945 in London about his alleged experiences at the <a href="/a/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz Camp</a>, where we read, among other things:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sometimes those entering the <a href="/h/homicidal-gas-chambers/index.html">gas chamber</a> were given a <a href="/t/towels-soap-toothbrushes-inside-gas-chambers/index.html">towel and a piece of soap</a>. This most certainly would never have happened, considering the mess it would have created and the effort necessary to retrieve and clean these items afterwards.</li>
				<li>First, the air was pumped out with electric motors, then <a href="/toxins-chemicals/zyklon-b/index.html">Zyklon B</a> was thrown in through one hatch in the ceiling. The claim that a vacuum was created first before adding toxic gas is technical and toxicological nonsense. Creating a vacuum in a brick-and-mortar building is technically impossible (the external pressure would crush the walls), hence most certainly was not done. Vacuum claims are frequently found in statements about the <a href="/t/treblinka/index.html">Treblinka Camp</a>. There were supposedly four <a href="/technologies/zyklon-b-introduction-devices/index.html">Zyklon-B introduction columns</a> going through the ceiling, not one hatch.</li>
				<li>The corpses were taken to the <a href="/instruments/tool/crematoria/index.html#Auschwitz_Birkenau">crematoria</a> on little carts. None of the crematoria had tracks with carts. This tale may have been plagiarized from the <a href="/documents/war-refugee-board-report/index.html">War Refugee Board Report</a>, which spread the same untruth &mdash; a convergence of lies.</li>
				<li>Cremation was carried out <q>by an electrical current of 6,000 volts.</q> In fact, all <a href="/instruments/tool/crematoria/index.html">cremation furnaces</a> in German wartime camps were heated with coke.</li>
				<li>If the SS wanted to hurry things up, the victims were killed in their clothes. However, after the gassing, the <a href="/concepts/sonderkommando/index.html"><i>Sonderkommando</i></a> members supposedly had to undress corpses, which most certainly took much longer than had the living inmates undressed themselves beforehand, which the orthodoxy claims.</li>
				<li>This witness&rsquo;s <q>very careful estimate</q> of the Auschwitz death toll amounts to 3 million Jews plus one million non-Jews, which happens to coincide with the Soviet propaganda lie of four million Auschwitz victims, a convergence of lies.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				From this hodgepodge of untrue statements, it is clear that the witness had no first-hand knowledge about any of it, but relied on false rumors and clich√©s. And yet, the Jewish Central Information Service in London, which collected this statement, stated this about the report:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					We have carefully checked our informant&rsquo;s identity and reliability, and are certain that his report is true in every detail.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
