				Jozef Cyrankiewicz (23 Apr. 1911 &mdash; 20 Jan. 1989) was a Polish socialist/communist politician who was active in the Polish resistance movement during the war. He was captured by the Germans and sent to the <a href="/a/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz</a> Camp, where he supposedly helped organizing the camp&rsquo;s resistance groups, although that is contested today. He was one of many communists influential in creating and spreading false anti-German wartime <a href="/manipulation/propaganda/index.html">propaganda</a>. For instance, in one message sent out to the <a href="/p/polish-underground-reports/index.html">Polish underground</a> on 21 January 1943, he wrote:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					Gas. Entire transports are sent directly to the gas, without registering anyone at all. The number [of those murdered] in these transports already exceeds 500,000. Mostly Jews. Lately, transports of Poles from the Lublin Region are going directly to the gas (men and women). Children are thrown directly into the fire. Behind Birkenau the so-called &lsquo;eternal flame&rsquo; burns &mdash; an open-air burning of corpses; the crematorium cannot cope.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				At that time, however, only some 143,000 Jews had been deported to Auschwitz, of whom some 82,000 are said to have been killed in gas chambers (see <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Rudolf2019b">Rudolf 2019b</a>).
			</p>
			<p>
				In early October 1944, Cyrankiewicz wrote in another message sent out to the Polish underground:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					The gassing never ends: 3,000 prisoners from <a href="/locations/ghettos/theresienstadt/index.html">Theresienstadt</a>; 2,500 from Auschwitz I, II, and III; 6,000 Jewish women from Weimar; 500 male Jews from the ghetto in Lodz; 400 prisoners from <a href="/b/buchenwald/index.html">Buchenwald</a>. Selections from among the sick and the unhealthy for gassing continue unabated.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				All of this is freely invented. In fact, the claim that 6,000 Jewesses from Weimar were gassed is so preposterous that Polish historian <a href="/persons/propagandist/czech-danuta/index.html">Danuta Czech</a> changed that to read in her book <i>Auschwitz Chronicle,</i> <q>6,000 female Hungarian Jews</q> (<a href="/bibliography/index.html#Czech">Czech 1990</a>, p. 724), but no documentation exists for that either. (For more details, see <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Mattogno2022b">Mattogno 2022b</a>, pp. 257, 266-271.)
			</p>
			<p>
				After the war, Cyrankiewicz played a major role in the oppressive Polish-Communist postwar government.
