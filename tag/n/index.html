				Marcel Nadsari (or Nadjari) was a Greek Jew who was deported to Auschwitz in April 1944. He survived the war, and in 1947 wrote down some memoirs. In 1980, a thermos bottle was found near the ruins of Crematorium III at Birkenau containing several handwritten pages in Greek which are signed with Nadsari&rsquo;s name. In &hellip;

In 1939, one of Nebe&rsquo;s subordinates, Christian Wirth, got involved in supervising the so-called euthanasia action, which is said to have consisted of killing severely mentally disabled patients with bottled carbon-monoxide gas.

Its relevance for Holocaust historiography lies in claims about a few select homicidal gassings in that camp. There is no wartime source for this. No documents confirm any witness claim in this regard, and &hellip;
