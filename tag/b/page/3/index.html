				The Buchenwald Camp was located some 4 miles northwest of the central-German city of Weimar. No historian has ever claimed or is currently claiming that any kind of systematic extermination of inmates by any technical means occurred at the Buchenwald Camp. Therefore, this camp would not have a place in an encyclopedia on the Holocaust, &hellip;
