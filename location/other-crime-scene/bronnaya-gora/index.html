				Bronnaya Gora is a Belorussian town located on the railway line from <a href="/brest/index.html">Brest</a> to Minsk, some 110 km northeast of Brest. In mid-October 1942, the <a href="/brest/index.html">Brest Ghetto</a> was evacuated and the roughly 17,000 Jews residing in it were officially resettled elsewhere according to German wartime documents. A Soviet investigative commission report, later published in the Soviet propaganda tome <i>The Black Book,</i> claimed instead that 30,000 Jews from that Brest region were taken between June and November to Bronnaya Gora, forced to strip naked, executed, and buried in mass graves 400 m northwest of the Bronnaya Gora train station.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another Soviet report about Bronnaya Gora dated 15 September 1944 jacked up the death toll to 50,000, although the documented number of ghetto residence in October 1942 was just under 17,000. The Soviets described eight mass graves, but there is no evidence that photos were taken or any exhumations with forensic examination were made.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a result, orthodox historians posit that the Jews from the Brest Ghetto were not resettled but rather killed at what they call the Bronnaya Gora extermination site. For instance, Israeli historian Yitzhak Arad claims that 48,000 Jews were killed at this site, and that their bodies were later exhumed and tracelessly burned during the so-called <a href="/instruments/einsatzgruppen/aktion-1005/index.html"><i>Aktion</i> 1005</a>, an operation of German units to erase the traces of their alleged atrocities. However, there is no documentation about that alleged erasure of traces either. But this claim conveniently explains why the Soviets evidently did not even try to exhume and examine the contents of any alleged mass graves.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Brest Ghetto is only some 80 km away from the <a href="/camps/sobibor/index.html">Sobibór Camp</a>. If that camp was an <a href="/instruments/camp/extermination-camps/index.html">extermination camp</a>, as the orthodoxy insists, the question arises why the Jews of the Brest Ghetto weren&rsquo;t shipped there and process at this allegedly highly efficient death factory.
