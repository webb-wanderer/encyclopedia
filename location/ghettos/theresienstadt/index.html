				In November 1941, the garrison (fortress) section of the northern Czech town of Theresienstadt (Terezin in Czech), some 12 miles southeast of the city of Aussig (Czech: Ústí nad Labem), was turned into a ghetto for Czech and elderly German Jews, as well as privileged German Jews, among them Jewish luminaries and many decorated veterans of the First World War and their families. Later, deportees from other countries arrived there as well. Over the years, many of the ghetto inhabitants were transferred to other camps, among them most prominently <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The orthodox narrative has it that the Theresienstadt Jews arriving at Auschwitz were either gassed on arrival or at a later date. However, a detailed analysis of the sources of these assertions reveals that they are based on rumors and unreliable witness reports (<a href="/witness/victim/cyrankiewicz-jozef/index.html">Józef Cyrankiewicz</a>, <a href="/witness/victim/kraus-ota/index.html">Ota Kraus</a>, <a href="/witness/victim/kulka-erich/index.html">Erich Kulka</a>, <a href="/witness/victim/langfus-leib/index.html">Leib Langfus</a>, <a href="/witness/victim/wolken-otto/index.html">Otto Wolken</a>). They are usually either unconfirmed by any documents, or are even refuted by them.

			</p>
			<p>
				Former Theresienstadt inmate <a href="/witness/victim/rosenblat-herman/index.html">Herman Rosenblat</a> claimed in 2008 that a <a href="/instruments/tool/homicidal-gas-chamber/index.html">homicidal gas chamber</a> existed at the Theresienstadt Ghetto. However, his entire wartime memoirs were exposed as a fraud even before they were published. (See the entry on him.)
