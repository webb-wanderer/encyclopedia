<p>Stefan (István) Szende (10 April 1901 &mdash; 5 May 1985) was a bilingual Austro-Hungarian Jew who started a moderate political career in Berlin as a Socialist just prior to Hitler&rsquo;s ascension to power. He was eventually arrested in late 1933 for continuing a socialist party, then tried and sentenced to two years imprisonment for this <q>offense.</q> After his release, he was first in Czech and then in Swedish exile, where he started a career as an author. In 1944, his book titled <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Szende"><i>The Last Jew in Poland</i></a> was published first in Swedish, and a year later also in English and German. The book is about the claimed extermination of Polish Jewry, although it is unknown what Szende&rsquo;s sources were. Judging by its contents &mdash; he refers to Poles who have heard stories of unknown Jews who escaped from <a href="/instruments/camp/pure-extermination-camp/belzec/index.html">Belzec</a> &mdash; Szende at best relied on Polish underground reports which had reached Sweden.</p>
<p>On the Bełżec Camp, his book contains the following peculiar claims (see <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Szende">Szende 1944</a>, pp. 263-265; <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Szende_Folkmann">Szende/Folkmann</a>, pp. 159-161):</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Five million people were slated to be killed on <i>Führer</i>&rsquo;s order, all of them evidently at Belzec. However, no such <a href="/document/hitler-order-final-solution/index.html"><i>Führer</i> order</a> has ever been located.</li>
<li>The Germans, as highly talented people, had highly efficient engineers of death. Put in charge by the Gestapo, after months of planning and constructing, they solved the technical problems involved in the mass slaughter of millions with the latest modern technical means. That needs to be expected if it were true, but there is no trace of any inventing, planning, constructing, testing of any highly efficient solution, and certainly no modern one.</li>
<li>The result of this huge engineering effort was the scientific slaughter-house at Belzec: a facility occupying <q>an area almost five miles across.</q> Actually, the camp itself was only some 250 meters across, not even a sixth of a mile. The largest size ever claimed by a witness for a Belzec extermination building is 100 m × 100 m (<a href="/witness/victim/reder-rudolf/index.html">Rudolf Reder</a>), but all other anecdotal evidence points at much smaller facilities.</li>
<li>Trains with Jews drove into a tunnel beneath the execution building. No such thing ever existed.</li>
<li>After disembarking and getting undressed &mdash; although later, the Jews allegedly were put naked into the train to save time &mdash; the victims<br />
<blockquote><p>were herded into a great hall capable of holding several thousand people. This hall had no windows and its flooring was of metal. Once the Jews were all inside, the floor of this hall sank like a lift into a great tank of water which lay below it until the Jews were up to their waists in water. Then a powerful electric current was sent into the metal flooring and within a few seconds all the Jews, thousands at a time, were dead.</p>
<p>The metal flooring then rose again, and the water drained away. The corpses of the slaughtered Jews were now heaped all over the floor. A different current was then switched on and the metal flooring rapidly became red hot, so that the corpses were incinerated as in a crematorium and only ash was left.</p>
<p>The floor was then tipped up and the ashes slid out into prepared receptacles.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>On certain days, 20 to 30 trains loaded with 3,000 to 5,000 Jews each were processed, hence between 60,000 and 150,000 people per day!</li>
</ul>
<p>This is totally at odds with the current mainstream narrative. The orthodoxy currently claims that the Belzec Camp first had a wooden shack with three small gas chambers, then a larger, ill-defined one made of brick and concrete. Execution was supposedly carried out by feeding engine-exhaust gasses of Diesel engine into the rooms (if we believe the pathological liar <a href="/witness/perpetrator/gerstein-kurt/index.html">Kurt Gerstein</a>), even though <a href="/instruments/tool/diesel-exhaust/266/index.html">Diesel-engine exhaust gases</a> are unsuitable for mass murder. Furthermore, the orthodoxy insists that there was no electricity involved in neither the killing nor the cremation. The latter supposedly occurred on huge pyres in <a href="/instruments/tool/open-air-incinerations/index.html">open-air incinerations</a>.</p>
