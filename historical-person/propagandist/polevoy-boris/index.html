			<p>
				Boris Nikolaevich Polevoy (aka Kampov; 17 March 1908 &mdash; 12 July 1981) was a Soviet journalist writing primarily for Soviet Russia&rsquo;s leading newspaper <i>Pravda</i>. His m√©tier was similar to <a href="/ehrenburg-ilya/index.html">Ilya Ehrenburg</a>&rsquo;s: glorifying communism and the Soviet Union, and as Pravda&rsquo;s official war correspondent during the war, exaggerating and inventing atrocity tales about the enemy and spreading them most effectively. (See <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Heddesheimer2002">Heddesheimer 2002</a> for more details.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Polevoy was among the Soviet troops who entered the abandoned <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz Camp</a> on 27 January 1945. Here are some of the claims he made about that camp in his two first reports of 29 January and 2 February 1945 (for details, see <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Mattogno2021">Mattogno 2021</a>, pp. 294f.):
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The eastern part of the camp had hundreds of mass graves containing several hundreds of bodies of murder victims each. In fact, the four <a href="/location/other-crime-scene/mass-graves/index.html#Auschwitz">mass graves</a> that once contained probably between ten and twenty thousand typhus victims were located in the west of the camp.</li>
				<li>The camp had a crematorium almost 500 m long, equipped with shaft furnaces, in which corpses burned within 8 minutes. The actual <a href="/instruments/tool/crematoria/index.html#Auschwitz-Birkenau">crematoria</a> buildings were some 50 m long, and they had normal-sized coke-fired cremation furnaces burning one corpse per muffle within an hour.</li>
				<li>Another building had metallic floors, in which victims were killed with high-voltage current. The floor opened, the corpses fell onto conveyor belts slowly moving to the shaft furnaces, where they were burned; the bones passed through rolling mills, and the resulting powder was used to fertilize the camp&rsquo;s gardens. All this is pure mendacious fantasy.</li>
				<li>Special mobile devices existed for killing children. Not even the most dogmatic orthodox historian has ever come up with anything to support that claim.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Mainstream historian Robert Jan van Pelt stooped to justify Polevoy&rsquo;s lies, while also acknowledging they belong to the <q>category of myth</q> (see Mattogno 2023b, pp. 80-82).
