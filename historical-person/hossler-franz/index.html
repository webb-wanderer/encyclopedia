				Franz Hössler (4 Feb. 1906 &mdash; 13 Dec. 1945), SS <i>Obersturmführer,</i> started his career at the SS as a cook at the <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/dachau/index.html">Dachau Camp</a>. He assumed that same role when transferred to <a href="/a/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz</a> in June 1940, then became Labor Service Leader in early 1941 at the <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/auschwitz-main-camp/index.html">Auschwitz Main Camp</a>, and eventually leader of the women&rsquo;s protective-custody camp at <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/birkenau/index.html">Birkenau</a> in August 1943. After a short stint at a subcamp of the <a href="/instruments/camp/natzweiler/index.html">Natzweiler Camp</a>, he returned to Auschwitz in June 1944, and was there leader of the Main Camp&rsquo;s protective-custody section. After the evacuation of Auschwitz, he first served in the same role at the Dora Camp, and then ended up at the <a href="/instruments/camp/other-camp/bergen-belsen/index.html">Bergen-Belsen Camp</a>, where he was arrested by the British.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the usual treatment by the British &mdash; commonly involving <a href="/event/torture/index.html">torture</a> &mdash; Hössler compliantly wrote an affidavit, in which he pledged full cooperation with his captors. Hössler was incriminated by one of his former SS colleagues, <a href="/witness/perpetrator/broad-pery-s/index.html">Pery Broad</a>, and by two former inmates (<a href="/witness/victim/kula-michal/index.html">Michał Kula</a>, Zygmunt Smużewski) of having organized the gassings at the old <a href="/instruments/tool/crematoria/index.html">crematorium</a> at the Main Camp (see <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Mattogno2016c">Mattogno 2016c</a>, pp. 58f.; <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Mattogno2022f">2022f</a>, pp. 61, 63). In his affidavit, Hössler denied any responsibility for gassings, and explicitly stated that he knew of gassing only because <q>everyone [&hellip;] knew about it</q> or because he had learned about it <q>through conversation with the doctors.</q> (See <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Phillips">Phillips 1949</a>, p. 714.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Hössler was a defendant during the <a href="/legal/trial/bergen-belsen-trial/index.html">Bergen-Belsen Show Trial</a>, where he was sentenced to death, despite his co-operation, and subsequently hanged.
