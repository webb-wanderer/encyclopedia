				The Gross-Rosen Camp, located near a town of that same name in Lower Silesia, was initially a labor subcamp of the Sachsenhausen Camp, but became an independent concentration camp in 1941. Its relevance for the Holocaust is strictly limited to the unique and false claim by former Gross-Rosen inmate Isaac Egon Ochshorn, that this camp &hellip;

				The Dora-Mittelbau Camp, located a few miles northwest of the city of Nordhausen, was the nucleus of a network of forced-labor camps in and around the Harz Mountains in Thuringia, Central Germany. It served primarily to provide a slave-labor force to factories of Germany&rsquo;s defense industries. Among them featured most prominently the underground production facilities &hellip;

				According to some sources, certain German wartime camps are said to have had facilities for the mass murder of inmates, such as homicidal gas chambers, but all historians without exception reject these claims as false, based either on false rumors, distorted hearsay, misunderstandings or outright black-propaganda lies. These camps, some of which have been completely &hellip;

				Trawniki was a forced-labor camp located half way between the Belzec and Sobibór Camp. It was established in the fall of 1941. Some 20,000 Jewish inmates are said to have passed through this camp. The camp also served as a training facility for SS men, among them Soviet PoWs, most of them Ukrainians, who volunteered &hellip;
