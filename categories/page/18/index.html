				<a href="/persons/politician/nebe-arthur/index.html">Nebe, Arthur</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Arthur Nebe (13 Nov. 1894 &mdash; 21 March 1945), SS Gruppenführer, became head of Germany&rsquo;s Criminal Police in 1936. In 1939, one of Nebe&rsquo;s subordinates, Christian Wirth, got involved in supervising the so-called euthanasia action, which is said to have consisted of killing severely mentally disabled patients with bottled carbon-monoxide gas. Hence, Nebe was probably &hellip;

			<p>
				Between the summer of 1942 and September 1944, some 105,000 Jews were deported from the Netherlands, mainly to Auschwitz and Sobibór, but some also to Theresienstadt, with the ultimate destination again being Auschwitz. The first set of transports between July 1942 and February 1943 went to Auschwitz. Their fate there was probably similar to that &hellip;

			</h3>
			<p>
				The Neuengamme Concentration Camp was established in 1938 near a village of the same name some 13 miles southeast of Hamburg. Its relevance for Holocaust historiography lies in claims about a few select homicidal gassings in that camp. There is no wartime source for this. No documents confirm any witness claim in this regard, and &hellip;

			</h3>
			<p>
				As soon as Germany had defeated Poland in late September 1939, Reinhardt Heydrich, head of Germany&rsquo;s Department of Homeland Security (Reichssicherheitshauptamt, RSHA), issued directives on how to handle the <q>Jewish question</q> in the occupied territories. One of these directives was the so-called Nisko Plan, which foresaw the creation of a Jewish reservation in southeastern Poland &hellip;

				The Dora-Mittelbau Camp, located a few miles northwest of the city of Nordhausen, was the nucleus of a network of forced-labor camps in and around the Harz Mountains in Thuringia, Central Germany. It served primarily to provide a slave-labor force to factories of Germany&rsquo;s defense industries. Among them featured most prominently the underground production facilities &hellip;

			<p>
				Some 800 Jews were deported from Norway, with the Auschwitz Camp as their main destination. Few of these Jews reported back with the local authorities after the war. Most of them have gone missing, and their fate is unclear. (See the entry on Jewish demography for a broader perspective.)

				Dawid Nowodowski was one of the first witnesses to testify about the Treblinka Camp. He was deported there on 18 August 1942, but managed to escape after just a few days. On 28 August 1942, hence before any propaganda or alleged witness accounts about this camp started spreading, he wrote a <q>Report of the stay &hellip;

				During the International Military Tribunal (IMT) in Nuremberg, the Allied victors tried what they perceived as the 24 major German war criminals. However, already during the preparation of this tribunal, the victorious powers agreed that many more suspected war criminals needed to be prosecuted. But since it had proven very difficult to get all four &hellip;

In it, he described the structure of Crematoria II and III rather accurately. But there are some peculiarities of his testimony, for which he relied exclusively on camp rumors: The victims &hellip;

He signed a deposition about his alleged experiences, which was filed by the United Nations War Crimes Commission in September 1945.

				At a military training ground near the German town of Ohrdruf, some 16 miles southwest of Thuringia&rsquo;s capital Erfurt, a forced-labor camp was established in November 1944. Due to Germany&rsquo;s rapid collapse at that time, the camp never had a chance of developing any proper infrastructure. Therefore, living conditions were atrocious, death rates catastrophic.
