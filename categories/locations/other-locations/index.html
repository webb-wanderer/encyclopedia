			<p>
				Morgues, also called mortuaries, serve to temporarily store human corpses awaiting identification, autopsies and burial or cremation. To slow decay, they are usually chilled to temperatures close to the freezing point, and they are equipped with efficient ventilation systems to remove gases resulting from decomposition. In the context of the Holocaust, it is worthwhile knowing &hellip;

				Within the context of the Holocaust, the Chinese city of Shanghai played a role prior to and during the war as a temporary safe haven and transit stopover for some 20,000 Jews fleeing Europe and the Soviet Union. The reason for this is that Shanghai did not require any visas for Jews to enter and &hellip;
