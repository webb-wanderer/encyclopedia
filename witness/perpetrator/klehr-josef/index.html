				Josef Klehr (17 Oct. &mdash; 23 Aug. 1988), SS <i>Oberscharf√ºhrer</i> at the end of the war, was an SS guard at the <a href="/absurdities/buchenwald/index.html">Buchenwald Camp</a> from 1939 for a year. He then served as a medical orderly at the <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/dachau/index.html">Dachau Camp</a>, until he was transferred to <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz</a> in early 1941, where he fulfilled that same role. In addition to this duty, he also became the head of the camp&rsquo;s disinfestation unit in 1943. As such, he organized and supervised delousing operations and disinfestation facilities operating with various methods (hot air, <a href="/toxin-chemical/zyklon-b/index.html">Zyklon B</a>, later also <a href="/toxin-chemical/ddt/index.html">DDT</a> and <a href="/technology/microwave-delousing/index.html">microwave ovens</a>).
			</p>
			<p>
				During the <a href="/legal/trial/frankfurt-auschwitz-show-trial/index.html">Frankfurt Auschwitz show trial</a>, Klehr was framed by former Auschwitz inmates, as well as by historians of the <a href="/location/museum-memorial/auschwitz-museum/index.html">Auschwitz Museum</a>, for the invented crime of <a href="/instruments/tool/lethal-injections/index.html">lethal injections</a> with <a href="/toxin-chemical/phenol/index.html">phenol</a>. He was also implicated as one of the main actors during the invented <q><a href="/event/first-gassing-at-auschwitz/index.html">first gassing</a></q> at Auschwitz. Klehr&rsquo;s function as head of the camp&rsquo;s disinfestation unit further exposed him to mendacious claims by vengeful witnesses of having supervised the use of <a href="/toxin-chemical/zyklon-b/index.html">Zyklon B</a> for mass gassings.
			</p>
			<p>
				Klehr was sentenced to life imprisonment for 475 counts of murder and 2,730 counts of assisting in murder. After almost 20 years of imprisonment, Klehr was interviewed by a German journalist fishing for confessions. He was successful, but only in general terms by getting Klehr to declare that <q>people were gassed.</q> No details were ever asked of him, and neither did he volunteer any (<a href="/bibliography/index.html#Demant">Demant 1979</a>, p. 114).
			</p>
			<p>
				How can anyone cope with having to spend the rest of one&rsquo;s life in prison for a crime that never happened, when the entire world insists it did? In such a situation, where any relief is impossible, insisting on one&rsquo;s innocence only leads to feelings of total senselessness, abandonment, desperation and depression, and ultimately suicide. Some went that route, such as <a href="/historical-person/koch-ilse/index.html">Ilse Koch</a>; but Klehr chose to accept the court-imposed <q>truth,</q> and to adjust his recollection accordingly.
