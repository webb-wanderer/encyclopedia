<h2>Erber, Josef</h2>

<p>Josef Erber (16 Oct. 1897 &mdash; 31 Oct. 1987), SS <i>Oberscharführer</i> at war&rsquo;s end, was an ethnic German from Bohemia. He was deployed to the <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz Camp</a> in November 1940, where he served first as a guard, then in the armory, and finally from mid-1942 in the Political Department of the Auschwitz Camp (camp Gestapo).</p>
<p>After the war, Erber was one of the defendants during the <a href="/legal/trial/frankfurt-auschwitz-show-trial/index.html">Frankfurt Auschwitz Show Trial</a>. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for contributing to the murder of 70 people while serving at the Political Department, but released early in 1986.</p>
<p>While in prison, he gave an interview to German journalist <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Demant">Ebbo Demant (1979)</a>, during which he made statements indicating that he had learned by heart the orthodox Auschwitz narrative, including its various absurdities. For example, he stated that the <q>gas chambers</q> of the Crematoria II and III at Birkenau (their Morgue #1) had a capacity of 3,000 people. This room had a surface area of 210 m². Hence, the <a href="/concept/packing-density-inside-gas-chamber/index.html">packing density</a> would have amounted to more than 14 people per square meter, which is physically impossible.</p>
