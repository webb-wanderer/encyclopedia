				Janda Weiss was a 14-year-old teenager deported from the <a href="/location/ghettos/theresienstadt/index.html">Theresienstadt Ghetto</a> to <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz</a> in May 1944. After the war, he made a deposition which was printed in a U.S. compendium on the <a href="/absurdities/buchenwald/index.html">Buchenwald Camp</a>. Here are some of Weiss&rsquo;s peculiar statements:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>On arrival, he saw <q>horrible tongues of flame coming out of</q> the crematorium chimney. However, the Birkenau coke-fired crematoria could not emit <a href="/absurdities/flames-out-of-crematory-chimneys/index.html">flames from their chimneys</a>.</li>
				<li>He claimed that <q>it was well known that every transport was gassed after six months.</q> The orthodoxy insists, however, that, starting in July 1942, individuals deemed unfit for labor were selected from each transport and killed instantly, the rest admitted to the camp.</li>
				<li>Only the strongest men and women were sorted out, the rest gassed. And Janda Weiss, at age 14, claimed to have been among the strongest of this transport.</li>
				<li>Paying tribute to the clich√©, the ineluctable Dr. <a href="/historical-person/politician/mengele-josef/index.html">Mengele</a> allegedly did the initial selection, and the one for the <a href="/concept/sonderkommando/index.html"><i>Sonderkommando</i></a> assignments. However, on arrival, no inmate could have known the identity of any SS men.</li>
				<li>He visited the barracks of the <i>Sonderkommando</i> members, where he found out <q>about the horrors of the <a href="/instruments/tool/crematoria/index.html#Auschwitz_Birkenau">crematorium</a>.</q> However, the orthodoxy has it that this unit was isolated from the rest of the camp, hence could not be <q>visited.</q> Furthermore, considering that all camp sectors were surrounded by barbed wire fences, walking around visiting people was simply no option in general.</li>
				<li>Old people were allegedly dumped from trucks into burning trenches while still alive. However, the heat of the blaze would have set the truck on fire if such a procedure had been tried.</li>
				<li>He claimed to have later worked in the crematorium as a <i>Sonderkommando</i> member, so he must have had first-hand knowledge, but he claimed that the undressing room was <q>in front of the gas chamber.</q> That description fits for no claimed facility, though.</li>
				<li>People were allegedly asked to put their <q>shoes into the cubbyholes,</q> meaning there were large shoe-storage shelves. This is a unique claim and flies in the face of the orthodox narrative.</li>
				<li>Inside the gas chamber <q>were three columns for the ventilators, through which the gas poured in.</q> However, the ventilators were placed in the building&rsquo;s attic, and the orthodoxy has it that there were <i>four</i> <a href="/technology/zyklon-b-introduction-devices/index.html">Zyklon-B introduction devices</a> in the alleged homicidal gas chambers of Crematorium II and III.</li>
				<li><q>Small children were thrown in[to the gas chamber] through a window.</q> However, that basement room had no windows.</li>
				<li><q>The lungs of the victims slowly burst.</q> The poison allegedly used &mdash; <a href="/toxin-chemical/hydrogen-cyanide/index.html">hydrogen cyanide</a> &mdash; has no such effect.</li>
				<li>The killing lasted about <q>three minutes.</q> However, in a facility without means to accelerate the evaporation of the liquid poison from the carrier material (<a href="/toxin-chemical/zyklon-b/index.html">Zyklon B</a>) and the dissipation into the large room, such short execution times are physically impossible.</li>
				<li>The chamber was opened right after the killing was over. However, the presence of poison gas in this room would have required a lengthy <a href="/technology/ventilation/index.html">ventilation</a> time.</li>
				<li>If the cremation furnaces could not keep up, surplus corpses were thrown into fire trenches. However, with such a blaze causing severe burns to anyone approaching it, it must be assumed that they used catapults to sling the corpses onto the blazing pyre from a safe distance. Furthermore, <a href="/document/air-photos/index.html#Auschwitz">air photos</a> prove that no such open-incineration trenches existed at that time.</li>
				<li><q>Once it happened that a victim crawled out of a burning trench.</q> Not likely.</li>
				<li><q>Once Moll put a naked woman in the trench and shot her in the genitals.</q> This is Holo-porn. Weiss evidently had some unsatisfied sexual issues.</li>
				<li><q>On another occasion he [Moll] arranged twelve women who were lined up behind each other in a row, [&hellip;]. Then he mercilessly shot through them all with a single bullet.</q> Not possible.</li>
				<li><q>He [Moll] hanged a man up by his hands and shot him until his arms were torn through; then he hanged him up by the feet and repeated the process.</q> Possible only with a huge waste of ammunition, which can be ruled out.</li>
				<li>Weiss also repeated a Chinese-whisper story, retold in variations by many, of a Jewess dancing naked in front of SS men, then taking one of their guns and shooting them. Again, this is yet more Holo-porn.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Whatever the motive of a 14-year-old teenager were to tell these outrageous lies, the problem really is not so much his lurid fantasy, but grownups who take that at face value and print it as <q>evidence</q> in a book.
