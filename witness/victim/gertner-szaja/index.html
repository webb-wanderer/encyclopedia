<h2>Gertner, Szaja</h2>

<audio id="audio-309-1" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="/wp-content/uploads/GertnerSzaja.mp3" /></audio>
<p>Szaja Gertner was a Polish Jew who was deported to <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/auschwitz/379/index.html">Ausch­witz</a> from Łódź, Poland, on an unknown date. His testimony was published in a Polish book in 1945. Right after his arrival, he claims to have been assigned to the so-called <a href="/concept/sonderkommando/index.html"><i>Sonderkommando</i></a>. There he claims to have witnessed things that are absurd or demonstrably impossible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each person received a receipt for the clothing they left behind when undressing to be gassed, which is a unique and nonsensical claim.</li>
<li>They all received a piece of <a href="/absurdities/towels-soap-toothbrushes-inside-gas-chambers/index.html">soap and a towel</a> to take with them to the <q>shower,</q> a useless waste of resources, plus no one takes towels into a shower.</li>
<li>Rather than calming the victims to make them cooperative, the Germans began to beat the inmates to cause confusion.</li>
<li>The panicking victims <q>threw themselves on top of each other, and fled from each other,</q> a completely senseless way of acting.</li>
<li>Then, the victims were driven from the showers into <q>the chamber,</q> meaning that the shower room was clearly <i>not</i> the gas chamber. So, they had actual showers? And then the freshly cleaned Jews were gassed?</li>
<li>The gas was thrown in through a window, though that room had no window, and the orthodoxy insist of the poison having been introduced through ceiling holes by way of some special <a href="/technology/zyklon-b-introduction-devices/index.html">Zyklon-B introduction device</a>.</li>
<li>After the gassing, <a href="/technology/ventilation/index.html">ventilation</a> through mere opening of doors and windows took only five minutes, an impossibly short time.</li>
<li>The <i>Sonderkommando</i> inmates dragging out the corpses put <q>cotton plugs</q> into their mouth to protect against the gas that <q>escaped from the bodies as soon as they were moved,</q> although cotton plugs offer no protection at all against <a href="/toxin-chemical/hydrogen-cyanide/index.html">hydrogen-cyanide</a> vapors.</li>
<li><q>Railway tracks ran from the door of the gassing room to the furnace,</q> where the rail carts carrying 40 corpses each dumped this load onto a huge grate. No crematorium in Auschwitz had railway tracks going from any room to the furnace room.</li>
<li>The cremation grate was heated with a strong electric current, turning the corpses to ashes within just 10 minutes. But no electrically heated furnace was ever erected in any German wartime camp. Cremations of <i>single corpses</i> in such furnaces take as long as those in other furnaces, hence around an hour.</li>
<li>The witness moreover fantasized about a large fan blowing the cremation ashes into a separate pit, where a worker <q>filled a barrel with ashes, and a winch pulled it up.</q> No document, no material trace and no other witness tale substantiates this unique claim.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some parts of this testimony echo aspects of atrocity propaganda spread by the <a href="/document/polish-underground-reports/index.html">Polish underground</a> during the war, which indicates the likely source of this witness&rsquo;s claims.
