<h2>Kon, Stanisław</h2>

<p>Stanisław Kon was a former <a href="/instruments/camp/pure-extermination-camp/treblinka/index.html">Treblinka</a> inmate who told a Soviet investigator on 18 August 1944 that some three million people were killed in Treblinka. In a Polish testimony of 7 October 1945 taken by Polish judge <a href="/historical-person/legal-professional/lukaszkiewicz-zdzislaw/index.html">Łukaszkiewicz</a>, he testified that he had learned only from hearsay how inmates were allegedly killed at this camp: the killing began in June 1942 &mdash; although the camp opened only end of July that year.</p>
<p>Initially, arriving inmates were allegedly killed with machine guns, because the execution chambers weren&rsquo;t ready yet. But this is an absurd claim: SS men gunning down crowds of newly arrived inmates, with bullets flying everywhere. Still, both the wrong starting date and the machine-gunning claim were mentioned by another Treblinka survivor, <a href="/turowski-eugeniusz/index.html">Eugeniusz Turowski</a>, who was interviewed by Polish judge Łukaszkiewicz on that same day. This is a clear case of <q><a href="/concept/convergence-of-evidence/index.html">convergence of evidence</a></q> on a lie. <a href="/berger-oskar/index.html">Oskar Berger</a> also claimed this early starting date combined with machine-gun killings.</p>
<p>Once the execution chambers were ready, they killed <q>by means of pumping out the air or by introducing engine-exhaust gases,</q> meaning he didn&rsquo;t know and wasn&rsquo;t sure &mdash; just as <a href="/kon-abe/index.html">Abe Kon</a> had changed the method from one to the other within just five days (see <a href="/kon-abe/index.html">Abe Kon</a>), thus switching to exhaust gases, which has been accepted by the orthodoxy as the <q>truth.</q></p>
<p>For Kon, excavators dug up buried corpses and dumped them onto a pyre that was constantly burning, meaning that the excavator was evidently fire-proof, and the corpses burned without fuel all by themselves. However, <a href="/absurdities/self-immolating-bodies/index.html">self-immolating bodies</a> simply do not exist. Kon also claimed that the camp was inspected by SS generals, and that <a href="/plan-order/wartime-leader/himmler-heinrich/index.html">Himmler</a> had <a href="/event/himmler-visits/index.html">visited the camp</a> in early 1943, which is devoid of any historical reality.
