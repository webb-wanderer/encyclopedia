				Ota Kraus (7 Sept. 1909 &mdash; 10 July 2010) was a Czech Jew who was arrested in 1940 for distributing resistance magazines. He was interned at <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz</a> from November 1942 until October 1944, when he was transferred to <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/sachsenhausen/index.html">Sachsenhausen Camp</a>. In Auschwitz, he headed the inmate metalworking shop together with the Czech Jew <a href="/kulka-erich/index.html">Erich Kulka</a>. After the war, they both wrote a book titled <i>The Death Factory,</i> which was translated into German and published by a Communist East-German publisher in 1957. See the entry about <a href="/kulka-erich/index.html">Erich Kulka</a> for more.

				During the Krakow trial against some of the former Auschwitz camp staff, Kraus testified succinctly that the <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/birkenau/index.html">Birkenau Camp</a> was <q>the extermination camp of all peoples. The Jews came first, then the Poles and Czechs had to follow.</q> Kraus then gave his <q>calculations</q> about the total death toll, which were actually based on tales he claimed to have received from <q>people who worked in the so-called &lsquo;<i>Kanada</i>&rsquo; and the &lsquo;<a href="/concept/sonderkommando/index.html"><i>Sonderkommando</i></a>&rsquo; and from the secretaries at the Political Department</q>, because he knew them all. According to this, roughly 2 million Poles, <q>150,000 Czechs, 500,000 Hungarians, 250,000 Germans, 90,000 Dutch, 60,000 Belgians, 80,000 Greeks and several ten thousand Yugoslavs, Italians and others died in the gas chambers,</q> plus <q>about 400,000 people who were political prisoners, so that the total number of deaths in Brzezinka [Birkenau] amounts to 4,000,000.</q> This neatly jibed with the Soviet propaganda lie of 4,000,000 victims. (See <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Mattogno2021d">Mattogno 2021d</a>, pp. 77f.)
