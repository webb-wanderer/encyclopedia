				Aaron Pilo was a Greek Jew who was interned at Auschwitz from January 1943 to January 1945, where he claimed to have worked inside the <a href="/instruments/tool/crematoria/index.html#Auschwitz_Birkenau">crematoria</a>. In June 1945, he signed a statement, in which he claimed the following, among other things:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Each of the crematoria could cremate 3,000 bodies a day. However, each muffle could cremate only one corpse per hour, hence some 20 per day (leaving four hours to shut down, clean and reheat the hearths). At 46 muffles, that yields a theoretical maximum of 920 corpses daily for <i>all</i> crematoria, rather than 12,000.</li>
				<li>During his two years in Auschwitz, five million corpses were cremated in the crematoria. This is a million more even than the outrageous Soviet four-million propaganda figure.</li>
				<li>Up to 3,000 people fit into a gas chamber, which is an impossible <a href="/concepts/packing-density-inside-gas-chamber/index.html">packing density</a> of more than 14 people per square meter in the largest claimed gas chamber, Morgue #1 of Crematoria II and III.</li>
				<li>A gassing lasted 3 minutes, which is absurdly short and physically impossible.</li>
				<li>The victims&rsquo; <a href="/object/hair-of-deportees/index.html">hair</a> was used to produce hats, because that&rsquo;s what Germany&rsquo;s military needed to win the war.</li>
				<li>The corpses were cremated in the crematoria by pouring gasoline over them, then tossing them into the fire. Here, the witness confounded stories told about how bodies allegedly were burned on pyres with the cremation procedure in furnaces.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				This witness was merely regurgitating camp rumors and atrocity claims, but evidently had never worked in a crematorium. (For more details, see <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Mattogno2021d">Mattogno 2021d</a>, pp. 227-229.)
