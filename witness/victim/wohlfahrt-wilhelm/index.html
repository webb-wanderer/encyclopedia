<h2>Wohlfahrt, Wilhelm</h2>

<p>Wilhelm Wohlfahrt, a Pole living in Warsaw, was incarcerated in the <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz</a> Camp on 8 January 1942. In March of that year, he was assigned to the camp&rsquo;s <a href="/concept/construction-office/index.html">Construction Office</a>, where he was employed as a surveyor who was permitted to leave the camp area to do his job. This is even confirmed by extant camp documents. He testified during the trial against former camp commandant <a href="/perpetrator/hoss-rudolf/index.html">Rudolf Höss</a>.</p>
<p>In a brief passage during that statement, he spoke of having seen from a distance of 400 to 500 meters, through his surveying instruments, how bodies were being loaded onto carts near what he called the <q>little red house</q> near the <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/birkenau/index.html">Birkenau</a> Camp (which refers to <a href="/concept/bunkers/index.html">Bunker</a> 1). He did not describe anything about the building or any mass-murder procedure, only that he saw bodies. He located this alleged facility somewhat farther away from the camp than the orthodoxy claims today, but that may be incidental.</p>
<p>Wohlfahrt briefly described <q><a href="/concept/bunkers/index.html">Bunker</a> 2</q> (which he called <q>little white house</q>) as a building with four evenly dimensioned gas chambers of some 4 by 7-8 m in size, each of some 30 m², hence a total of some 120 m². This is the only feature he mentioned that can be checked against other witness claims and reality. The orthodoxy&rsquo;s narrative is largely based on <a href="/dragon-szlama/index.html">Szlama Dragon</a>&rsquo;s postwar statements. However, Dragon insisted on four <i>unevenly</i> sized rooms, all with the same length, but with varying widths in a ration of roughly 12:7:4:2.5. Another witness, <a href="/paisikovic-dov/index.html">Dov Paisikovic</a>, has claimed three equally sized rooms. They all made it up, however, because the foundation walls of a former building, which the orthodoxy claims are the ruins of <q><a href="/concept/bunkers/index.html">Bunker</a> 2,</q> still exist today. It shows seven irregularly sized and arranged rooms.</p>
