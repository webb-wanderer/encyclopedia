<h2>Bialek, Regina</h2>

<p>Regina Bialek was a Polish Jewess deported to <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/auschwitz/379/index.html">AuschÂ­witz</a> in July 1942 and later transferred to <a href="/instruments/camp/other-camp/bergen-belsen/409/index.html">Bergen-Belsen</a>. She participated in the British <a href="/legal/trial/bergen-belsen-trial/index.html">Bergen-Belsen Show Trial</a>, for which she deposited an affidavit on 26 May 1945, which contains a remarkable string of lies (see <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Mattogno2021">Mattogno 2021</a>, pp. 344f.):</p>
<ul>
<li>Following the pattern of common cliches about Auschwitz, she claimed to have been selected by Doctor <a href="/historical-person/politician/mengele-josef/index.html">Mengele</a> to be gassed, because she had fallen ill with typhus.</li>
<li>She insists to have been driven in a truck down a ramp straight into the gas chamber, where she and her fellow sufferers were allegedly unceremoniously dumped on the gas-chamber floor. In fact, there was no such building at Auschwitz allowing for such a procedure.</li>
<li>Rather than <a href="/toxin-chemical/zyklon-b/index.html">Zyklon-B</a> granules poured through some opening, as the orthodoxy asserts, for Bialek the lethal gas was piped into the room, hissing from a floor outlet in the middle of the room.</li>
<li>She described the effects of the toxic gas by saying that people started <q>to bite their hands and foam at the mouth and blood issued from their ears, eyes and mouth and their faces went blue.</q> She, too, claims to have suffered from all these symptoms. None of this can possibly have been the effect of <a href="/toxin-chemical/hydrogen-cyanide/index.html">hydrogen cyanide</a>, the active ingredient in Zyklon B, which the orthodoxy insists was used in these chambers.</li>
<li>Miraculously, just before dying, Dr. Mengele allegedly opened the gas chamber in mid-gassing, while full of toxic fumes, located her in the tangled mess of dying people, and led her from the chamber.</li>
<li>Members of the inmate staff working in the gas chambers were killed in <q>a villa in the camp</q> by throwing in <q>gas bombs</q> through a window.</li>
</ul>
