				Oskar Strawczyński was a Polish Jew deported to the <a href="/instruments/camp/pure-extermination-camp/treblinka/index.html">Treblinka</a> Camp, where he claims to have arrived on 5 October 1942. He was interviewed about his experiences on 7 October 1945. His knowledge about the claimed exterminations occurring at that camp are all from hearsay:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					From the accounts of Hersz Jabłkowski, who was a blacksmith and came from Stoczek Węgrowski, <q>I know what the gas chambers looked like.</q> &mdash; Jabłkowski allegedly helped build the gas-chamber facility.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Strawczyński stated that there were four concrete chambers measuring 3 m &times; 3 m &mdash; while the orthodoxy insists on three wooden (4 m &times; 4 m) or ten concrete chambers (8 m &times; 4 m).
			</p>
			<p>
				He didn&rsquo;t know how the killing was done, but assumed either vacuum or exhaust gases.
			</p>
			<p>
				He claimed that during the first 130 days of the camp&rsquo;s operation, three trains with 60 cars each packed with 100 people, arrived every day and were exterminated at the camp. This amounts to some 2,340,000 victims &mdash; as opposed to the some 800,000 claimed by the orthodoxy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Erroneous hearsay information, unfounded speculations and exaggerated death-toll claims are the hallmarks of this testimony that isn&rsquo;t worth the paper it is written on. A book co-authored with another self-proclaimed Treblinka survivor, Israel Cymlich, appeared in 2007 with the title <i>Escaping Hell in Treblinka.</i> Sixty years of exposure to massively memory-manipulating influences (see the entry on false-memory syndrome) certainly did not make his claims &mdash; or Cymlich&rsquo;s first-time claims &mdash; on alleged exterminations more relevant or reliable.
