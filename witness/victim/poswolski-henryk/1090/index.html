				Henryk Poswolski was a Polish Jew deported from the <a href="/instruments/ghetto/warsaw-ghetto/index.html">Warsaw Ghetto</a> to the <a href="/instruments/camp/pure-extermination-camp/treblinka/index.html">Treblinka</a> Camp in January 1943, where he was employed as a bricklayer and stoker. However, he was not working at the camp&rsquo;s extermination sector, which was physically and optically cordoned off from the rest of the camp. (What he was stoking, then, remains a mystery.) Therefore, he had no access to it, and no first-hand knowledge about it. His hearsay story includes the following claims:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <a href="/instruments/tool/homicidal-gas-chamber/index.html">homicidal gas chambers</a> even had washbasins installed to fool the victims. This is a unique claim that makes no sense, unless those basins actually worked.</li>
				<li>Two of the gas chambers had collapsible floors. <q>Under the floor passed carts with which the corpses were carried away.</q> This claim, usually connected with the <a href="/location/camps/sobibor/index.html">Sobibór</a> Camp, is unique for Treblinka, technically extremely challenging and thus unlikely, completely unfounded, and rejected by all historians, orthodox or heterodox.</li>
				<li>A Diesel engine first created a vacuum, then introduced engine-exhaust gases. However, <a href="/instruments/tool/diesel-exhaust/index.html">diesel exhaust</a> is unsuited for mass murder, and creating a vacuum in a brick-and-mortar building is technically impossible (the external pressure would crush the <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Mattogno2021e">walls),</a> hence most certainly was not done.</li>
				<li>The bodies were burned using not wood, but a <q>certain white powder</q> as an evidently magical flame accelerant.</li>
				<li><a href="/plan-order/wartime-leader/himmler-heinrich/index.html">Himmler</a> visited the camp in March 1943, ordering that all buried corpses be burned. In fact, there is no trace of <a href="/event/himmler-visits/index.html">Himmler ever visiting</a> the Treblinka Camp.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				This is yet another example of why testimonies from hearsay should never be permitted, either in courts of law or in historiography. (For more details, see Mattogno 2021e, pp. 159f.)
