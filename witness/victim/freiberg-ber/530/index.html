<h2>Freiberg, Ber</h2>

<audio id="audio-530-1" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="/wp-content/uploads/FreibergBer.mp3" /></audio>
<p>Ber (or Berisch) Freiberg was an inmate of the <a href="/location/camps/sobibor/index.html">Sobibór Camp</a>. In three depositions of 10 and 18 August 1944 and 27 July 1945, he claimed that executions at Sobibór happened in just one <a href="/instruments/tool/homicidal-gas-chamber/index.html">gas chamber</a>. A gas, perhaps chlorine, was produced by an electric machine, from where the gas was piped into gas tanks or cylinders, and from there through hoses or pipes into the chamber. The gassing was observed by an SS man through a roof window. After the murder, the floors opened, and the bodies were discharged into carts below, which brought them to mass graves.</p>
<p>All his claims are rejected as false by the orthodoxy, who insists on several gas chambers; on an engine producing lethal exhaust gas; on this gas being piped directly into the chambers; on no observation windows in the roof; and on no collapsible floor with carts underneath. The corpses were instead taken out of the chamber manually, sideways through a normal door.</p>
<p>Freiberg claimed in his 1945 deposition that he had no access to the camp sector where the gas chamber was allegedly located. However, in statements made in 1960 and 1965, he claimed to have been employed as a barber who cut off the hair of naked women <q>in a barracks in front of the gas chamber,</q> which means he was employed in that very camp sector.</p>
