				Bela Fabian was a Hungarian politician deported to <a href="/a/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz</a>, where he was employed in the camp&rsquo;s records office. He was evacuated to the West at war&rsquo;s end and managed to escape, reaching American lines. In an interview given to a U.S. official, he testified that, based on his experience with camp records, <q>up to June 1944, five million people had been gassed and burned</q> at Auschwitz. He also claimed to have seen <a href="/absurdities/flames-out-of-crematory-chimneys/index.html">flames</a> billowing from the crematorium chimneys, which was technically impossible. This witness also claimed that the Auschwitz crematoria burned 12,000 corpses daily on average, hence some 4,380,000 per year &mdash; a lie matching his lie about five million gassing victims. He furthermore spread the rumor that the Gypsies at Auschwitz were killed in August of 1944, a claim clearly refuted by documentary evidence (see the entry on <a href="/victim-groups/gypsies/index.html">Gypsies</a>). His final imaginative contribution concerns a selection among inmates at the camp&rsquo;s infirmary in late October 1944, leading to all seriously sick inmates being gassed and burned; this claim is unsupported by any document or any other witness story, and is refuted by rich documentation showing the life-saving <a href="/concept/healthcare/index.html">healthcare</a> that seriously ill inmates received at Auschwitz. (For more details, see <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Mattogno2021">Mattogno 2021</a>, pp. 389f.)
