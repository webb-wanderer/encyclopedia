<p>Milton Buki (or Michal Majlech) was a former <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/auschwitz/379/index.html">Auschwitz</a> inmate. He signed two English-language depositions on 4 and 7 January 1945 while in Linz, Austria. In the first deposition, which is geared toward framing SS man <a href="/perpetrator/erber-josef/index.html">Josef Erber</a>, he did not mention any homicidal gassings. His second statement is geared toward framing Gestapo man <a href="/perpetrator/grabner-maximilian/index.html">Maximilian Grabner</a> as one of the persons supervising homicidal gassings at Auschwitz. In it, he claimed to have been a member of the inmate unit dragging corpses out of the <a href="/instruments/tool/homicidal-gas-chamber/327/index.html">gas chamber</a> (the so-called <a href="/gertner-szaja/index.html"><i>Sonderkommando</i></a>, although Buki doesn&rsquo;t mention this term) from his arrival at <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/birkenau/414/index.html">Birkenau</a> in 1942 until late 1944, when gassings presumably stopped. In this affidavit, Buki only mentions <q>the crematorium</q> in the context of alleged gassings, evidently ignorant of the fact that there were four of them, and that gassings in 1942 supposedly happened in separate facilities today referred to as <q><a href="/concept/bunkers/index.html">bunkers</a>.</q></p>
<p>Twenty years later, he testified during the <a href="/legal/trial/frankfurt-auschwitz-show-trial/index.html">Frankfurt Auschwitz show trial</a>. While he knew nothing about any gassing facilities in little farmhouses (the <a href="/concept/bunkers/index.html">bunkers</a>) back in 1945, in 1965 he reported about his work at <q>little whitewashed</q> farmhouses, allegedly used for gassings before the <a href="/instruments/tool/crematoria/250/index.html">crematoria</a> were built. He gave a very terse description of a <q>little whitewashed</q> farmhouse and of a gassing taking place in it.</p>
<p>Some 15 years later still, on 15 December 1980, he signed a notarized statement, also not very long, but with a few more details. His statements contain a number of false claims and contradictions, revealing it all as mere fantasy:</p>
<ul>
<li>The only Auschwitz physician Buki mentioned by name who allegedly gave the order to pour <a href="/toxin-chemical/zyklon-b/index.html">Zyklon B</a> into <a href="/instruments/tool/homicidal-gas-chamber/index.html">homicidal gas chambers</a> is the ineluctable Dr. <a href="/historical-person/politician/mengele-josef/index.html">Josef Mengele</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/toxin-chemical/zyklon-b/index.html">Zyklon B</a> was inserted through a small chimney, to which one had to climb on a ladder, while the orthodoxy insists on a small wall opening, easily within reach and closed with a shutter. In his Frankfurt testimony, he had claimed that the gas was introduced through a window.</li>
<li>Death occurred either within 6 to 8 minutes (his 1945 statement) or within some twenty minutes (his 1980 statement).</li>
<li>Corpses in the gas chamber <a href="/absurdities/standing-upright-dead-gassing-victims/index.html">remained standing</a> after their death &mdash; impossible.</li>
<li>The room was only aired out between 20 to 30 minutes before Buki and his fellow inmates had to drag out the corpses &mdash; which would have led to their poisoning, as it would have taken at least a day to air out a facility devoid of any <a href="/technology/ventilation/index.html">ventilation</a> system and windows.</li>
<li>The corpses are said to have had blue stains on their bodies, while <a href="/toxin-chemical/hydrogen-cyanide/index.html">hydrogen-cyanide</a> poisoning leads to pink marks.</li>
</ul>
