				The Pole Narcyz Tadeusz Obrycki was deported to <a href="/a/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz</a> on 13 May 1943. In December 1946, he signed an affidavit about his time there. In it, he described the structure of <a href="/instruments/tool/crematoria/index.html#Auschwitz_Birkenau">Crematoria</a> II and III rather accurately. But there are some peculiarities of his testimony, for which he relied exclusively on camp rumors:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The victims were given <a href="/absurdities/towels-soap-toothbrushes-inside-gas-chambers/index.html">towels and soap</a> before entering the <a href="/instruments/tool/homicidal-gas-chamber/index.html">gas chamber</a>. This most certainly would never have happened, considering the mess it would have created and the effort necessary to retrieve and clean these items afterwards. In addition, no one takes towels into a shower.</li>
				<li>He claimed the alleged gas chamber was equipped with fake showers, when indeed there were <a href="/absurdities/showers/index.html">real showers</a> in that basement room.</li>
				<li>The poison gas was allegedly administered by launching a cartridge from the outside &mdash; rather than by pouring a can of Zyklon-B pellets through some opening, as the orthodoxy has it.</li>
				<li>There were five furnaces with five openings each &mdash; although <a href="/instruments/tool/crematoria/index.html#Auschwitz_Birkenau">Crematoria</a> II &amp; III had five <i>triple</i>-muffle furnaces.</li>
				<li>Two corpses were loaded into one muffle at a time &mdash; whereas these muffles were designed for only one corpse. Although loading two would have been physically possible, it wouldn&rsquo;t have had much of an advantage, if any.</li>
				<li>Five million Jews were cremated in the crematoria and on the pyres &mdash; one million more than the Soviets&rsquo; atrocity lie, and four million more than today&rsquo;s mainstream narrative.</li>
				<li>The crematorium staff was liquidated every three months &mdash; this is the echo of a rumor proven false by the many survivors of this staff.</li>
				<li>These crematorium staff members slated for murder were gassed at a facility in Gleiwitz (today&rsquo;s Gliwice), where no such facility existed. That&rsquo;s a lie invented by <a href="/kula-michal/index.html">Micha≈Ç Kula</a>, and as such we see here another <q><a href="/concept/convergence-of-evidence/index.html">convergence of evidence</a></q> on a lie.</li>
			</ul>
