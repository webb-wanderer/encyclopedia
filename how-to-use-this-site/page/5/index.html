				Judging by the scale and scope of civil-rights violations and atrocities committed, the Soviet Union under Lenin and Stalin was a terrorist state second probably only to Pol Pot&rsquo;s Cambodia. The primary Soviet organization implementing and enforcing this rule of terror was the terrorist organization NKVD, later renamed to NKGB. Within the Red Army, the &hellip;

				Israel After it had turned its Arab neighbors into lethal enemies with its genocidal war of 1948, Israel had to maintain huge armed forces to secure its spoils of war and prevent an Arab revenge. These armed forces were utterly disproportionate to Israel&rsquo;s financial and economic abilities. Hence, within a few years, Israel was in &hellip;

				Concentration camps are prison camps for civilians incarcerated without due process. They were first created by the Spanish during the 1897 Cuban War of Independence. They were employed in subsequent years by the British (Boer War) and Americans (war against the Philippines). Concentration camps made their first appearance in Europe with the 1918 Bolshevik revolution &hellip;

				Every concentration camp of the Third Reich had a construction office (Bauleitung), which was in charge of building and maintaining the camp and its facilities. During the initial setup of a camp, this office was usually called a <q>new-construction office</q> (Neubauleiung). Larger camps (that had subcamps with their own construction offices) had one that organized &hellip;

				The <q>convergence of evidence</q> is a paradigm based on the observation that seemingly independent pieces of evidence all, or at least in their majority, point in the same general direction of an event or a perpetrator, even if they disagree on particulars. Historically, this paradigm was first applied by the judiciary during medieval witch trials&hellip;.

				Imagining one&rsquo;s body burn is a veritable nightmare for us all. Hence, the cremation of the human body is a prime topic for propaganda stories, because it is easy to make an audience exposed to such stories shudder in horror. For this reason, the cremation of alleged victims of claimed German wartime atrocities is a &hellip;
