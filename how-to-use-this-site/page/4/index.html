			<p>
				Brest, back then called Brest-Litovsk, is a Belorussian City close to the border to Poland. It belonged to Poland since 1921, but to Belorussia since 1939. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, a ghetto for Jews was established in that city. According to German wartime documents, altogether almost 9,000 Jews from that ghetto &hellip;

				In 1941, British Intelligence analysts cracked the German <q>Enigma</q> code used to encrypt radio traffic between German forces and their headquarters. This gave the British access to top-secret German data, among them for example the positions of German U-boats. This was an ingenious breakthrough which contributed considerably to Britain and the Western Allies winning World &hellip;

				The Buchenwald Camp was located some 4 miles northwest of the central-German city of Weimar. No historian has ever claimed or is currently claiming that any kind of systematic extermination of inmates by any technical means occurred at the Buchenwald Camp. Therefore, this camp would not have a place in an encyclopedia on the Holocaust, &hellip;

				Janina Buchholcowa was a Polish Jewess who signed a deposition sometime in 1945, where she asserted to have been deported to the Treblinka Camp. She claimed that, at the beginning of the camp&rsquo;s existence (at the end of July 1942), the gas chambers were not yet ready.

				Although Bulgaria was Allied with wartime Germany, no Jews were deported from that country or murdered there. Since Bulgaria was known as a relatively safe haven, several thousand Jews actually sought and found refuge there. (See the entry on Jewish demography for a broader perspective.)

				Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless and odorless gas which is highly toxic to vertebrate animals, but not to non-vertebrates such as insects. CO clings more strongly than oxygen to the hemoglobin of vertebra blood, hence preventing oxygen transportation by the blood. Since the combination of CO and hemoglobin is more intensely red than the &hellip;
