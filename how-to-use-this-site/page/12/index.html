				Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 &mdash; 30 April 1945) is the central figure in the Holocaust narrative. Considering the monolithic nature of Hitler&rsquo;s dictatorship, his decisions, orders and decrees are what should have caused, started and shaped the progress of the Holocaust. Yet when we look at the historical records, all we have are some &hellip;

				While many high-ranking German wartime officials claimed ignorance after the war about a National-Socialist extermination program of the Jews, Hermann Göring was the first person to express skepticism about the Holocaust narrative imposed upon the world by the prosecution during the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal (see the entry on him, and Heliotis 2018b).

				The growing political influence of the LGTBQ+ movement has led to efforts to publicize the victim-status of homosexuals in National-Socialist Germany, who were said to also be targeted for systematic extermination. Following the general pattern of Holocaust hagiography, the number of homosexuals alleged to have died in National-Socialist concentration camps has been extremely exaggerated over &hellip;
