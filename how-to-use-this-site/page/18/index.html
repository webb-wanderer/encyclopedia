		<p>Arthur Nebe (13 Nov. 1894 &mdash; 21 March 1945), SS Gruppenführer, became head of Germany&rsquo;s Criminal Police in 1936. In 1939, one of Nebe&rsquo;s subordinates, Christian Wirth, got involved in supervising the so-called euthanasia action, which is said to have consisted of killing severely mentally disabled patients with bottled carbon-monoxide gas.
