			<p>
				The Yad Vashem World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem is one of the most important sites of the orthodox Holocaust ideology, second only perhaps to Auschwitz itself. The Center runs a museum, a research center, and an online Holocaust encyclopedia. But the most ambitious project of this institution is the attempt to identify all victims &hellip;

				Yugoslavia was dismembered during the Second World War: It consisted of German-aligned Croatia, German-occupied Serbia and areas temporarily occupied/annexed by neighboring countries. In the present context, we focus on Serbia and Croatia. (See the entry on Jewish demography for a broader perspective.) Serbia In July 1941, a major uprising occurred in Serbia, which the German &hellip;

				Matvey Zaydel (aka Motle Zaidl), a Jew from Vilnius, Lithuania, was interrogated by a Soviet commission, whose report is undated, but probably dates from 1946. According to this report, Zaydel claimed to have been arrested by German forces in October 1943. From December 1943 until April 1944, he was forced to exhume and burn corpses &hellip;

				Under (West) German law, a district attorney&rsquo;s office can investigate a crime only if either the crime location or the residence of a suspect is located in its area of jurisdiction. Since many claimed National-Socialist crimes were committed outside of Germany, and because the residence of many suspected perpetrators was either unknown, scattered around Germany &hellip;

				Several German wartime camps are said to have had homicidal gas chambers in which Zyklon B was used for mass murder (see the entry on Zyklon B). For most of them, the way Zyklon B is said to have been introduced is uncontested. The situation is different for the claimed homicidal gas chambers at Auschwitz, &hellip;
