			</h3>
			<p>
				After Germany&rsquo;s victory over Poland and the annexation of West Prussia and the Warthe Region in early 1940, German officials developed a plan called <q>Generalplan Ost</q> (<q>General Plan East</q>) that aimed at Germanizing these regions and resettling those parts of the population that they thought could not be integrated, including all Jews. These people were &hellip;

				The term <q>genocide</q> was legally defined only in 1948, when the United Nations adopted its genocide convention (see https://www.un.org/en/genocide-prevention/1948-convention). According to this convention, genocide does not require the mass murder of members of a defined group because they belong to that group. Already any measure that causes serious bodily or mental harm, deliberately creates conditions &hellip;
