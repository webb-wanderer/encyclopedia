				W&aacute;c&#322;aw D&#322;ugoborski (3 Jan. 1926 &ndash; 21 Oct. 2021) was a partisan (civilian) fighter during World War II in Poland. He was arrested for this in 1943, and deported to the <a href="/a/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz</a> Camp. After the war, he became a professional historian in Communist Poland, and among other things was curator for research at the <a href="/a/auschwitz-museum/index.html">Auschwitz Museum</a>. Together with Polish historian Franciszek Piper, he published a five-volume study of the Auschwitz Camp&rsquo;s history in 1999 that deals with extermination claims only superficially in its slim Volume 3 (English in <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Dlugoborski">D&#322;ugoborski/Piper 2000</a>). 
			</p>
			<p>
				In an interview with a German newspaper, he admitted in 1998 that, during the Communist time in Poland, historians had to lie about the history of Auschwitz: 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					Up until 1989 in eastern Europe, a prohibition against casting doubt upon the figure of 4 million killed was in force; at the memorial site of Auschwitz, employees who doubted the correctness of the estimate were threatened with disciplinary measures. 
				</p>
				<small><i>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,</i> 14 September 1998</small> 
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				This was the same year that <q>democratic</q> Poland introduced a law threatening any historical dissent in this regard with up to three years imprisonment, hence not just <q>disciplinary measures.</q> Considering that Poland still has active <q>Holocaust denial</q> laws in place, it is reasonable to assume that current historians at the Auschwitz Museum continue to lie, and that, in the future, they will point to present-day laws in defense of their ongoing historical falsifications.
