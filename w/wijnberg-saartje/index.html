				Saartje Wijnberg was the wife of Chaim Engel, and also an inmate of the Sobib&oacute;r Camp. In three depositions of 22 June and 19 July 1946 as well as 29 August 1949, she claimed that the gas was fed into the gas chamber(s) through <a href="/s/showers/index.html">showerheads</a>, and that, after the murder, the floors opened, and the bodies were discharged into carts below, which brought them to mass graves. The deposition signed together with her husband (19 July 1946) speaks of gas chambers, while her own ones mention only one chamber. In her mutual deposition with her husband, she also claimed a death toll of some 800,000 victims for the camp.
			</p>
			<p>
				All these claims are rejected as false by the orthodoxy. According to their narrative, the gas was fed through pipes rather than showerheads. These chambers did not have collapsible floors with carts underneath either. The corpses were instead taken out of the chamber manually, sideways through a normal door. Furthermore, only about a quarter million victims are said to have died in the camp.
