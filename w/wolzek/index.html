				<a href="/h/hoss-rudolf/index.html">Rudolf Höss</a>, the former commandant of the <a href="/a/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz</a> Camp, was captured by the British just before midnight on 11 March 1946. They subsequently <a href="/t/torture/index.html">tortured</a> him uninterruptedly for three days. After this, they had him write a confession about his alleged leading involvement in the extermination of the Jews. His handwritten confession was transcribed, and while doing so, the text was enhanced, and Höss was made to sign that enhanced version. One passage not included in the original manuscript reads as follows:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					In June 1941 I was summoned to Himmler in Berlin where he basically told me the following. The Fuehrer has ordered the solution of the Jewish question in Europe. Several so-called extermination camps already exist in the General Government (<a href="/b/belzec/index.html">BELZEK</a> near RAVA RUSKA eastern Poland, <a href="/t/treblinka/index.html">TREBLINKA</a> near MALINA [Malkinia] on the River BUG, and WOLZEK near LUBLIN).
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				The problem with this passage is that no camp by the name Wolzek or anything similar ever existed. There is also no town by that name. The third alleged extermination camp whose name should be there, if we follow the orthodox narrative, is <a href="/locations/camps/sobibor/index.html">Sobibór</a>, which was located some 80 km east of Lublin.
			</p>
			<p>
				One might assume that this invented name slipped in because, after three days of sleep deprivation and torture, Höss was capable of writing and saying anything, just to make the torture stop. However, this was no accident at all, because Höss did not correct this wrong name when discussing these three camps during an interrogation on 4 April 1946, and then expressly repeated this list of alleged extermination camps in an affidavit written after that interrogation on 5 April 1946;
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					I was ordered to establish extermination facilities at Auschwitz in June 1941. At that time, there were already in the general government three other extermination camps; Belzek, Treblinka and Wolzek.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				He confirmed the correctness of that list under oath during his <a href="/legal/trial/international-military-tribunal/index.html">IMT</a> testimony on 15 April 1946 (<a href="/bibliography/index.html#IMT"><i>IMT</i></a>, Vol. 11, p. 417), and repeated it once more in an affidavit of 20 May 1946:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					The older extermination camps Belsen [Belzec], Treblinka and Wolzek had used <a href="/c/carbon-monoxide/index.html">monoxide gas</a>.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Höss cannot plead lack of knowledge of the various camps existing in the Third Reich either. He was not only one of the longest serving and highest-ranking camp commandants, but he was actually promoted to the Inspectorate of Concentration Camps in late 1943. As such, it was his duty to supervise <i>all</i> the camps. Therefore, he was very well familiar with all the names and locations of all camps, and all the problems they had, because that was his job from late 1943 onward.
			</p>
			<p>
				It stands to reason that this was not an accident. Höss may well have included this fake name of a phantom camp repeatedly for a reason. And for those willing to see, the reason seems obvious: To show the world that his testimony was coerced nonsense. That is, it may have been Höss&rsquo;s message in a bottle, slipped out into the world without his tormentors noticing, containing the simple message that what he was saying was not true. If so, then the message has been received and understood.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once Höss was extradited to Poland, he couldn&rsquo;t use this ruse anymore, as the Polish investigators, in contrast to the rather clueless Brits, knew very well that no such thing as Wolzek ever existed. Hence, in his text written while in a Polish prison, Höss duly substituted Wolzek with Sobibór. This would then imply that some of the information contained in his account written in Poland was something spoon-fed to him by his Polish captors. And this indeed is what an analysis of Höss&rsquo;s text suggests.
