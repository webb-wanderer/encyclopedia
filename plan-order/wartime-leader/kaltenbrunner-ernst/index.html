<p>Ernst Kaltenbrunner (4 Oct. 1903 &mdash; 16 Oct. 1946) was Higher SS and Police Leader in Austria from 1938 until early 1943. On 30 January 1943, after <a href="/heydrich-reinhardt/index.html">Reinhardt Heydrich</a> had been assassinated the previous summer, Kalten­brunner replaced him as chief of Germany&rsquo;s Department for Homeland Security (<a href="/legal/institution/reichssicherheitshauptamt/index.html"><i>Reichssicherheitshauptamt</i></a>, RSHA).</p>
<p>However, all matters concerning the SS and its vast network of forced-labor industries and labor as well as concentration camps were integrated under the SS&rsquo;s Economic and Administrative Main Office headed by <a href="/witness/perpetrator/pohl-oswald/index.html">Oswald Pohl</a> (<i><a href="/legal/institution/wirtschafts-und-verwaltungs-hauptamt/index.html">Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungs-Hauptamt</a></i>). Therefore, Kaltenbrunner had nothing to do with the Third Reich&rsquo;s camp system.</p>
<p>In addition, the activities of the <a href="/instruments/tool/einsatzgruppen/index.html">Ein­satz­grup­pen</a> in terms of mass executions also petered out around the time of Kaltenbrunner&rsquo;s appointment. As a result of all this, Kaltenbrunner&rsquo;s name is completely absent from the entire documentation in the context of the so-called Holocaust. Orders on concentration-camp matters went directly from <a href="/himmler-heinrich/index.html">Himmler</a> to Pohl or <a href="/glucks-richard/index.html">Richard Glücks</a>. Kaltenbrunner was simply not involved.</p>
<p>In spite of all this, with <a href="/hitler-adolf/index.html">Hitler</a>, <a href="/himmler-heinrich/index.html">Himmler</a> and <a href="/heydrich-reinhardt/index.html">Heydrich</a> dead, Kaltenbrunner became the Allies&rsquo; scapegoat during the Nuremberg <a href="/legal/trial/international-military-tribunal/index.html">International Military Tribunal</a> (IMT). <a href="/witness/perpetrator/becher-kurt/index.html">Kurt Becher</a> framed him by falsely claiming that Himmler had issued a <q>stop extermination</q> order to Kaltenbrunner. Such an order implies that a prior <q>start extermination</q> order must have existed, and that Kaltenbrunner had the power to start and stop such a program.</p>
<p>Kaltenbrunner was also framed by former <a href="/instruments/camp/mauthausen/index.html">Mauthausen</a> inmate <a href="/historical-person/propagandist/marsalek-hans/index.html">Hans Maršálek</a>, who made outrageous claims about Kaltenbrunner in a post-war affidavit.</p>
<p>During Kaltenbrunner&rsquo;s defense at the IMT, his lawyer tried in vain to take advantage of the false affidavit and testimony of <a href="/witness/perpetrator/hoss-rudolf/index.html">Rudolf Höss</a>, the former commandant of the <a href="/instruments/camp/mixed-purpose-camp/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz Camp</a>. Höss had claimed that he had received an extermination order orally from <a href="/himmler-heinrich/index.html">Himmler</a> directly in June of 1941, hence a year prior to Kaltenbrunner&rsquo;s promotion to chief of the RSHA. Höss also claimed that he had been told by Himmler to keep this order a secret even from any superiors. However, since Kaltenbrunner&rsquo;s appointment to chief of the RSHA, SS matters were no longer within the RSHA&rsquo;s jurisdiction. (For more on this, see <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Mattogno2020b">Mattogno 2020b</a>, index entries on Kaltenbrunner; see also <a href="/bibliography/index.html#IMT"><i>IMT</i></a>, Vol. 11, esp. pp. 231-386 [Kaltenbrunner&rsquo;s testimony], 396-422 [Höss&rsquo;s testimony].)</p>
<p>It was all to no avail. Kaltenbrunner was sentenced to death for war crimes and crimes against humanity. He was hanged on 16 October 1946, at the age of just 43.</p>
