				The Greek Jew Leon Cohen was deported to <a href="/a/auschwitz/index.html">Auschwitz</a> and was registered there on 11 April 1944, although he claimed to have arrived <q>in late November [1943]</q>. He claimed to have been assigned to the so-called <i><a href="/s/sonderkommando/index.html">Sonderkommando</a>,</i> where he was deployed at what today is referred to as <q><a href="/b/bunkers/index.html">Bunker</a> 2.</q> He remained silent about his experiences until he was interviewed by Israeli historian <a href="/bibliography/index.html#Greif">Gideon Greif</a> in early 1990. He also published a book about his experiences a few years later (<a href="/bibliography/index.html#Cohen">Cohen 1996</a>). His accounts are riddled with false and implausible claims:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>He incomprehensibly called the SS guards <q>policemen.</q></li>
				<li>As has become fashionable among Auschwitz survivors, he claimed to have been selected by Dr. <a href="/m/mengele-josef/index.html">Mengele</a> on arrival.</li>
				<li>Sex sells, so he claimed something that is commonly associated with <a href="/k/koch-ilse/index.html">Ilse Koch</a>, the wife of the former camp commandant of the <a href="/b/buchenwald/index.html">Buchenwald</a> Camp:<br />
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						At [Mengele&rsquo;s] side, a very beautiful woman was leading two huge Alsatian dogs. This woman was reputed to be a nymphomaniac. She picked strong muscular men for one-night stands and when she had completely exhausted them, she killed them with her own hands and used their skin for lampshades or book bindings. I sometimes wonder, is this madness, could it really have happened? To make it worse, at the Nuremberg trials, which was a complete farce, she only received a prison sentence and even managed a quick release as she was pregnant. [&hellip;] Or am I talking nonsense?
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					This proves that Cohen was lying, since his alleged personal experiences in fact came from somewhere else.</li>
				<li>He claimed to have carried gassing victims to pits 3 meters deep, although a pit this deep would have filled with water due to the high <a href="/g/groundwater-level/index.html">groundwater level</a> in the area.</li>
				<li>He never mentioned the term <q><a href="/b/bunkers/index.html">bunker</a></q> in connection with the gassing facility, and did not describe it either; instead, he called the cremation pits <q>bunkers,</q> yet did not indicate either their number or size (other than that they were 3 m deep).</li>
				<li>He claimed that children&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s bodies were put at the bottom of the pyre, as if they were used to ignite the wood and men lying on top.</li>
				<li>He claimed that rail carts were used to transport corpses to the pits, although the orthodoxy insists that no such devices were used at Bunker 2 in 1944.</li>
				<li>He claimed that, while the pyre was ablaze, men with long poles stood on either side stoking the fire, although those men would have been severely burned.</li>
				<li>He claimed that, after the fire had died down, the pit had to be cleared of accumulated <a href="/f/fat-extracted-from-burning-corpses/index.html">fat</a>, although fat would have been the <i>first</i> thing to burn in a fire, and could never have accumulated in it.</li>
				<li>He claimed that, since the <a href="/h/homicidal-gas-chambers/index.html">gas chambers</a> didn&rsquo;t work fast enough, people were also gassed in <q>cattle trucks</q> parked in the fields &mdash; a unique and freely invented claim.</li>
				<li>His description of the <a href="/c/crematoria/index.html">crematoria</a> has little resemblance to reality. (He attributed a capacity of 2,000 victims per batch to all crematoria&rsquo;s gas chambers, which would have resulted in an impossible <a href="/p/packing-density-inside-gas-chamber/index.html">packing density</a> of 9.5 people per square meter for Morgue #1 of Crematoria II and III.)</li>
				<li>According to him, the gas made the victims turn <q>deep purple, nearly black,</q> although <a href="/h/hydrogen-cyanide/index.html">cyanide</a> poisoning turns the skin pink.</li>
				<li>He claimed that a physically impossible number of two to five corpses were pushed into a cremation muffle designed for only one corpse.</li>
				<li>The cremation of these two to five corpses is said to have lasted half an hour, when in fact the cremation of just one corpse took roughly an hour.</li>
				<li>He repeated the myth that the fat of women&rsquo;s bodies was used to burn the men&rsquo;s bodies, hence that corpses burned by themselves, without the need for fuel. However, <a href="/s/self-immolating-bodies/index.html">self-immolating bodies</a> simply do not exist.</li>
			</ul>
